1,McDonald's,"Seriously cannot stand this McDonald's. They NEVER get my order right. Food almost always sucks! Service is sorry! The employees sure do show they hate their jobs in the way they perform at work! I used to work at McDonald's as a teen getting through high school, don't remember that McDonald's ever taking so long in a drive-thru or being bitter about the fact I worked there! Lol And to top it all off, this is the McDonald's I live right across the street from :( so I find myself here more often than not! ugh! Get it together people! You guys are terrible! I honestly don't have anything nice to say about this place... I usually wouldn't review a place just to talk mess, but I waited at the drive-thru for 15 minutes this morning to get two coffees!!! Standards back when I worked there was a minute or less for each car!",2014-12-29,Glendale,-112.20502009999998,33.5095967,"['Burgers', 'Fast Food', 'Restaurants']"
5,Tom Colicchio's Craftsteak,"Amazing food, truly excellent best lobster bisque, and the prime rib, probably the bedt Ive had!!

5,Fishman Lobster Clubhouse Restaurant,"This was my second time here, and the seafood was just as awesome as I remembered! We got the King Crab & Lobster Dinner package. It comes with a soup, king crab cooked in 3 different ways (steamed, friend with dry garlic, and fried rice), HK style lobster (the lobster tower you see in all the photos), snow peas, and dessert. This package is meant for 4 people, and is $288 pre tax and tips. However, because all their king crabs were larger than the size that comes with this package (4.5lb), we had to pay additional for the extra weight. I think the amount of food that we got could probably have fed a party of 6. I love the fried lobster and crab legs here, both are super yummy! This restaurant is definitely worth a visit for any seafood lovers!

However, the restaurant does get very busy. So make sure to call ahead and make a reservation, esp if you plan on coming during the weekends! The tables in the restaurant are packed very tightly. The round table I was at was literally touching the table beside us. So don't come here if you are expecting a restaurant with a nice ambiance, or a place where you want to talk to your friends in private. Because the table beside you will definitely hear every word you are saying!",2015-11-24,Toronto,-79.3007954253,43.8242335814,"['Seafood', 'Restaurants', 'Chinese', 'Live/Raw Food']"
1,Bonjour Brioche,"Long story short.

Bunch of rude, heartless, and ignorant assholes run this place with no compassion for people especially people they feel do not belong or are suitable for their shitty establishment. 

My mother endured an extremely humiliating situation at Bonjour Brioche. She went in on a Saturday to wait for 45 mins with her cane, with nowhere to sit while she waited for her friend. A number of people who were waiting after her were seated before her, and she asked when she would get a seat until her friend arrived. She'd like to have a coffee while she waited. 

Basically was told, your friend's not here; tough shit no seat you can wait. She asked well what if my guest cancelled last minute and I would like to eat alone. Are you not going to serve me even if I sit and have something alone? 
they then started to tell her that they get that excuse all the time and that she could not get a table until her friend arrived. 

As she asked for the manager, her friend arrived at the same time. She explained to the manager that she's been waiting with her cane, hasn't been given a table and that people after her had been seated even if they were waiting for others. She felt demeaned and didn't appreciate the service and that she would be taking business somewhere else. Instead of the manager making some arrangement to ease the situation she told my mother that she can leave now. 

I have never in my life had my mother call me and cry on the phone of how humiliated and embarrassed she felt.

4,Dilly's Deli,"We grabbed some dinner here last night before catching a show at Gammage. 

We were the ONLY people in this place, yet the staff acted like they were slammed, very short with us and it took quite some time for our order to come out.

The food was good, though the bread bowls that the soup came in tasted like they were a few days old, very dry and crumbly vs the normal super fresh tasting bread bowls you get here.",2010-09-28,Tempe,-111.94536529999999,33.42217539999999,"['Caterers', 'Sandwiches', 'Event Planning & Services', 'Delis', 'Burgers', 'Restaurants']"

However, they have really gotten worse and worse for the past few months.  The service is hit and miss, the wait staff his also hit and miss.  We went on sunday march 6 and had to wait for food for over 30 minutes, food was cold and did not taste as good as usual, and the service was the worse.  We plan on going to biscuits or haymakers from now on.  Or Cracker Barrel, they are at least consistent",2016-03-08,Glendale,-112.1401263,33.714283200000004,"['Restaurants', 'Breakfast & Brunch']"

3,Zoozacrackers Deli,"What do you do if it's getting close to midnight and you still haven't had dinner because you've been sipping on margaritas in the lounge instead? One option is to head here for a quick nosh. I got the pastrami on rye (I felt the need to add the ""on rye"" when I ordered because I wasn't sure, being this is Vegas, if they might try to serve it on Wonder Bread), and while it's certainly not the best deli I had had, it will do in a pinch.

3,Anjappar Chettinad Restaurants,"I saw this restaurant on a whim when I was looking for a good indian food place to try and decided that this was the one. We opted for delivery because why not.

I usually judge the place based on my all time favourite Butter chicken and when I got it for sure this place has it down! It surpassed the other ones I tried and for sure this is where am getting it from now on.

Aside from that dish, we also got the chicken tikka masala and the garlic naan bread. The masala was alright, I tasted a better one elsewhere so this one wasn't really my favourite from them. And the garlic naan was yummy. Really generous with the garlic for sure. 

And I also got a Mango lassi, I didnt like their version that much so I think I'll skip on this one next time.

Anyway, I have yet to try their other dishes in the future so for now am just giving them three stars. And also the other reason for the rating was because our food arrived late. Am glad I waited a little bit more because I was close to complaining. But other than that, food is decent and I would order from them again.",2016-05-17,Mississauga,-79.64196609999999,43.5995957,"['Indian', 'Buffets', 'Halal', 'Restaurants']"
5,The King's Kitchen,"In town for a conference and checked Yelp for great local spots to eat. This place was recommended by the hotel staff and Yelp reviews only reinforced their recommendations. 

Atmosphere was great. Packed, but got seated quickly. Service was very friendly and suggested a couple specials. I had the pork chop dinner....it was incredible. The chop was so juicy. The polenta was great, and the glaze sealed the deal. Top 3 best meals of all time!! Im serious. 

The $9 house salad was disappointing (bland, no salt n pepper or flavor) with a ranch dressing that didnt come close to the flavor of ranch, more like a creamy herb I couldnt identify.  But I tell you, the pork chop meal completely made up for it. 

My colleagues got the gumbo and said it was really good, as well as the fried chicken. I very well may go there again tomorrow because it was that good!!",2014-10-16,Charlotte,-80.84432199999999,35.227757000000004,"['American (Traditional)', 'Restaurants', 'Southern', 'Bakeries', 'Food']"

Easily one of the best sushi places on town with a good atmosphere and good service.

Best things to eat/ recommendations:
1. Sashimi salad.  This thing was amazing.  A nice pile of salmon, yellowtail, and albacore with sweet cucumber and shrimp. 

2.  Be happy roll: surprise crunch inside a savory tuna, salmon, avocado roll.

3.  The shit.  This appetizer acts like as stuffed jalapeño but without the super spicy kick.

2,Gia Lai,"Like many other Yelpers, I stopped by with my Mom and sister for a late lunch and walked into a entirely empty restaurant. That always puts me on high alert since it's usually not a good sign. 

I ordered the beef pho, my sister got the chicken pho and my mom got the glass noodle chicken soup. We also tried the spring rolls and the crab rangoon. The spring rolls were just okay, but the crab rangoon I found to be super-greasy. And I've ordered this dish from some pretty seedy take-out places. It's never tasted that strange. My mom's soup came out with shrimp and some weird pork in it and had to be sent back. When dining with two other people, all eating soup, well... that's just unfortunate since cold soup isn't appetizing and eating while you're hungry mother waits isn't fun either.  My pho was just okay. My favorite pho spots in CLE blow what they served me out of the water, but it was edible. 

The server was very apologetic, but overall I just didn't find the value there for the quality of food you actually get. 

I will say they serve up some damn good, fresh limeade and sparkling limeade!",2014-11-24,Lyndhurst,-81.500377126,41.503135608499996,"['Restaurants', 'Vietnamese', 'Asian Fusion']"

2,Sammy's Woodfired Pizza And Grill,"No idea how the food here is. The apathetic hostess informed us that they were out of pizza, before we sat down, so we passed.

I've been around the food industry for a while, and this sort of thing tells me a lot about their attitudes. I would never eat at a place that runs out of their signature dish on a weekday afternoon.

It didn't feel like I was chewing on chicken at all; honestly. The food looked very attractive but it was soo disturbing.  I gagged 4-6 times in front of my own grandmother.  I felt like I was on Fear Factor doing the 2nd challenge!  The worst part is that becuz there are so few Chinese food places in Pickering, people are tricked into thinking that spicy dragon is the best.  It breaks my heart.

Les entrées étaient plutôt réussies: le duo de crab cake était savoureux et goûtait vraiment le crabe (un critère rarement respecté au resto!), alors que le chèvre chaud était goûteux mais était beaucoup trop sucré à mon avis (pomme cuite + BEAUCOUP de miel + caramel balsamique = trop!). C'est davantage au plat principal que notre expérience nous a déçus. Le duo de tartare (saumon et boeuf) manquait de saveur. Le tartare de boeuf n'était pas relevé, le tartare de saumon était insipide. La salade d'accompagnement baignait encore une fois dans sa vinaigrette, ce qui la rend impossible à manger et les frites sont très ordinaires (ne goûtent que le gras, texture sèche). Pour sa part, le ravioli de cerf aux champignons et à l'huile de truffe était beaucoup trop concentré en saveur. J'essayais d'enlever la sauce de mes pâtes avant de prendre une bouchée, ce n'est pas peu dire. Point fort de la soirée? Le long island iced tea: cocktail parfaitement bien exécuté!

The BF ordered the turkey sandwich with 1/2 & 1/2 of the offered sides, sweet potato & kale salad. I had a taste of each of the three items and they were all delicious. Next time, I'm ordering something from the sandwich column.

We also got their flour-less chocolate cake togo & ate it for breakfast the next morning w/our coffee. Yum.

3,Momofuku Noodle Bar,"My friend and I went to Momofuku for dinner during their first opening weekend. Thank goodness we arrived 20min before opening since there was already a line up when we got there. We managed to get a seat right at the windows which was a little awkward considering the fact that people outside can watch you eat.

 I read a number of reviews and opt to go for the Momofuku ramen, the rice cakes, the pork buns, and the Slushie. I thought the ramen was alright but nothing to rave about. I did like the pork belly that was used in it. The rice cakes were great! They were chewy and had the right about of hotness to it (compare to the ones you would get at Korean places where it was just too hot!). The best part was the pork buns. The pork belly was so moist and tender and the bun was just so soft. I would definitely go back there for them. 

The Slushie was interesting. It was both hot/sour and really hits you when you first take a sip of it. Really not for those who don't like hot/sour tastes.
 
Overwall, I thought the Noodle Bar was good even though the ramen wasn't that impressive. But the prok buns did win me over and I wouldn't mind going back there to try the others.

This place recently opened and our server was very attentive and took the time to explain the menu to us. He strongly favored the halibut tacos and said they were his single favorite thing on the menu so I ordered them. 

I need to note we were here for lunch so this is only a lunch review based on just one visit.

I soon received them and they were I think the most figure friendly meal I ever had out. Aprox. three oz. of halibut between two lettuce leaves (instead of tortillas) , pickled onion , Mexi style tomatoes , avocado , radish,  some crunchy greens and a very mild sauce. This plate was a bit on the mild side for my taste but maybe the intention of the dish was to taste the fish and not to over power it. This plate came with a side of black beans that were seasoned and had some flavors going on. This seemed like a very healthy meal to have out. I also liked that they used halibut and not something like muddy catfish or tilapia.

My husband tried the Charcuterie. It was sort of like an around the world kind of plate. It had five kinds of meat , a Chinese Sausage, a Hungarian Sausage, Italian Meats, Fig Jam, Toast, whole grain mustard, pickles, olives and a wedge of Brie Cheese.

I noticed an interesting Connecticut Style Steamed burger on the menu that you just don't find too often that might have been fun to try. Someone seated next to us got one and I thought it looked good.

He asked for crispy calamari and clearly his original order was just refried. It was awful. The main course both friends ordered the duck breast which was very tough, my lamb was not that tender either. The potatoes were dry and and the vegetables hard and undercooked. There are other restaurants in the area more deserving of my money. I will definitely not be going back.",2016-07-17,Toronto,-79.3808122,43.6647891,"['Restaurants', 'American (Traditional)', 'Caterers', 'Event Planning & Services', 'Mediterranean']"

3,Ciao Wine Bar,"I came here with high hopes for the Summerlicious menu. We started with the orecchiette though I should have ordered salad. It was a very generous portion for an appetizer and, along with the bread, filled us up quite substantially before we got to the ravioli. The ravioli was hearty, but also a bit heavy. The sauce and cheese filling made for a really filling meal. By the time we got dessert, I was stuffed and could barely finish it. The espresso tart was very rich, though it lacked a particular delicacy. 

The restaurant was quite full when we arrived and they initially seated us on the corner near the stairs, which was not at all a pleasant spot, but before we got settled in, the waiter found us a better table. I really enjoyed the ambiance -- enough lighting to see the food but not too bright. The food was served gradually, allowing us ample time to talk and catch up. The one catch was probably that splitting the bill at the end of the meal was weird, as the waitress rounded up from half of the total, which isn't good practice.

Overall I would say that the ambiance outdid the food. I was expecting something a little more delicate and less like what I can make for myself at home. It was worth a try though as I'd gotten a really good impression from the website and other reviews. I would probably not return unless something on the regular menu caught my eye.",2014-07-18,Toronto,-79.3936453,43.670475399999994,"['Wine Bars', 'Bars', 'Nightlife', 'Restaurants', 'Italian']"
5,New York Flavor,Tried this place cause it was highly rated on yelp. It did not disappoint. I had the Basil Marscapone burger. My son had the special Deniro Burger. Mine was tasty but not a strong taste. I thought it could use a little more flavor. The Deniro burger was absolutely delicious. Very flavorful. The fries were great. I also tried the potato salad and that was meh. But overall I want to go back and try more items. I will definitely try the Deniro again.,2015-03-17,Surprise,-112.38716699999999,33.63924,"['Delis', 'Burgers', 'Restaurants', 'Sandwiches', 'Breakfast & Brunch']"

2,Copacabana Brazilian Steakhouse,"Pros:
The food was fantastic and the gentlemen walking around with the various steaks and meats were attentive. The dancers were energetic and a ton of fun to watch. A clean, aesthetically pleasing restaurant to dine in. 

Cons:
We saw our waitress a total of 3 times in the 2 hours that we dined there. Once to take our original drink orders, once more to refill our drinks after we bothered another waitress when we were thirsty, and last when we were paying our bill with a different server (perhaps a floor manager?) to ""thank"" us. I don't know about other diners but my husband and I need more than one or two glasses of water to tide us over with that rich of a meal. We try our best to be easy guests but it was a little annoying to sit and watch other tables be tended to all night (other diners seeing their servers 5-9 times in their dining experience) with us sitting there never seeing our server again. I don't know if it was her fault or the restaurant's for stretching her too thin but it was incredibly frustrating. 

For $50 a person (making a two person bill easily $150 with tax and tip), the service was ridiculous. I can go to a bar and spend less than $20 with my husband and get better service and feel more welcome than we did here.",2016-04-18,Toronto,-79.3878309801,43.64834408229999,"['Bars', 'Restaurants', 'Nightlife', 'Brazilian', 'Barbeque', 'Steakhouses']"

I ordered the redneck club which has both pulled pork and brisket on it, along with some slaw...So, basically all of my dreams came true. And then I ordered the ghost pepper mac n' cheese as well. It is super spice and even more so when you add the inferno that is the ghost pepper bbq sauce. I loved it! My boyfriend ordered the ribs and the pepper jack mac n' cheese and was really happy with both. The ribs are intimidatingly large and a half rack was more than enough! The sauces are also all so delicious. I love the Carolina style sauce! It is my favorite!

The Mexican slaw is good even without the additional dressing. I ordered the 2 meat combination bulgogi plate, bulgogi taco, and the hubs ordered the bulgogi bowl and meat skewers. The price is a bit on the mid range, above take out and below dine it. 

3 star because of its 'generous meat portions' -

Someone explained the entire menu and the restaurant concept (order and pay at the counter first and you help yourself to condiments, drinks, and utensils) when I sat down.  Two people came by halfway through our meals to see if everything was okay as well.

The food.  We had hummus with pita to start.  I love hummus so this was no different.  The portion is pretty small though so I probably wouldn't get it again.  We got the full pack share platter.  It came with the MOST oily delicious garlic bread.  Remember to eat these before they get cold and hard.  The large side of veggies was SMALL and flavoured poorly.  It also mainly had onions in it which weren't really cooked through so I didn't enjoy this at all.  The mash potato on the other hand great!  ok so the chicken.  It was pretty moist and had lots of flavour.  But I was hoping the skin would be crispy and instead it was kind of soggy. Who doesn't love eating crispy chicken skin right?!

However, our amazing waiter was extremely helpful coming up with gluten free options for me.  He made sure to tell me that they offer both quinoa and rice based pastas along with a variety of sauces and even brought me some g-free bread!!  When I ordered my pasta with vodka sauce, he even went out of his way to look up if a non-grain based vodka needed to be used.  For someone with a dietary restriction, it was so nice to have a waiter that went out of his way to help me find a dish that I could eat and truly enjoy!!

I did tell them to leave off the green onions, but they forgot that, which was a little disappointing, considering they had no other orders then. The Karaage fried chicken and takoyaki balls were delicious and really nice to split between friends actually. 

Price-wise, it was $11.75 for the combo, which is a little higher than most lunches at ramen joints, but they include a side dish and drink along with it, so I suppose it balances out a little more.

Then, the waitress came back and did not apologize at all but simply said that he had to pick a different beer because they were out of that one.

They renovated this place to create a cool lounge/sports-bar/restaurant type of place, looks great. They also have free home delivery if you order above $25 I believe, which is fantastic!

At first impression I like the decor, the simplistic look, the colors all in all looks nice, but then you sit down and realize that the furniture is garbage, the chairs are way to small and hard and the tables are to low for even average people.

40 minutes later the food comes out and now really makes the point that this is a disaster, now the food is not bad let's make that clear but average at best, combine that with the horrible seating and poor service my conclusion is don't even bother.

This is a rare bad review from me in a town with a ton of dining offered, but the experience is so bad that I felt I had to do this.",2014-09-24,Las Vegas,-115.178216174,36.0689369963,"['Restaurants', 'Caterers', 'Event Planning & Services', 'Barbeque', 'Southern', 'Soul Food', 'American (Traditional)', 'American (New)']"

Well, the milkshake was as amazing as I remember them being. The fries however were nasty! I know, that is some extreme and mean language, but wow, the sauce in the chilli was all vinegar. And because the sauce coated pretty much every fry, I ended up throwing the whole dish out after three bites - three bites was all I could muster.

The menu is pretty big with a ton of options.  I ended up getting a glass of Cab Sav and the special:  baked cheese ravioli.  It was very good.

Our waitress was polite... a bit absent at times.  Didn't really affect the meal though.

The house salad dressing a creamy tomato basil dressing was pretty good.  At first I almost defaulted to ranch, but our server listed all of them off.

The portions are big, and the prices are  proportional to the dishes.  I'd say it's a solid 3-star that I want to give 4 to, but nothing really wowed me about my first visit.",2011-08-24,Charlotte,-80.7084629552,35.1719848281,"['Restaurants', 'Italian']"

Fresh Guacamole made table side allows you to have it made spicy or mild, your choice. Husband and I chose the street tacos. You choose any three out of 6 different tacos and served with rice and beans. Friend ordered the chicken enchiladas and her husband ordered the carne asade bowl. The green sauce on the enchiladas was good but spicy! The bowl was huge and tasty. Also order the grilled corn as it is the bomb! The corn is sweet and juicy and the coating is salty and slightly cheesy. Ended the meal with the flan. All four of us shared one as we were all stuffed but had to try it.

There were several different kinds of sandwiches to choose from. I got the chicken salad and it was delicious. Everyone else really liked their sandwiches too. The salad was also really good. Not your typical garden or Cesar salad. I'm not quite sure what it was but it had chicken, tomatoes, and feta.. yummy. Now we must also discuss the huge dessert platter that was in front of us. It was filled with chocolate covered strawberries, brownies, cookies dipped in chocolate, and more! I've never seen a dessert try like that before for a work lunch. Of course, I had to try a few of the items and they were all so good!

I would definitely make my way to their physical location in the future so that I can try out some other items.

I can't give a full review exactly, since I've only ordered with other people from work and not picked anything up personally or seen the inside, BUT - seriously some of the best Thai I've ever had. The first time I ordered, I got tofu and string beans. Vegetables weren't steamed to mush, and tofu was still firm. The sauce was perfect - curry with just a little spice. 

I've also ordered their coconut soup - which is by far my favorite. Again, I wasn't the one making the order, but from what I heard they were super friendly, and definitely accomodating- they gave me tofu instead of the meat at no extra charge. The coconut wasn't overpowering, but it was just enough to smooth out the tang of the lime.

On my most recent visit I sat at the bar with my boyfriend. We went in for a late lunch on a Saturday afternoon. We never got any food, we were never asked if we wanted any food. The bartender, some girl with Little Mermaid red hair, was too busy flirty with the older gentlemen at the bar. After sitting for 20 minutes without so much as a greeting we flagged her over. I don't come here too often and can't remember the wine on the menu I like. I'm certain there is one I really don't like so I asked if I could try a taste of two. She was instantly annoyed, the look was apparent on her face. She brought over two tastes and left, not to return for another 13 minutes; at this point, I was timing. We ordered drinks, she brought them and then left the bar. She was then gone, just completely absent. 

We had to flag her down one of the servers to get the tab, paid and walked out. The service was terrible. You'd get better service(and food!) at a Taco Bell or McDonalds.",2016-12-02,Phoenix,-112.03750210700001,33.5075723503,"['American (New)', 'Southern', 'Seafood', 'Barbeque', 'Restaurants']"

While it was still fairly tasty, there was very minimal amount of anything except pasta, and the beans seemed mushy like from a can.

I'm not a vegetarian, but I do try to eat healthily.  That generally means, more veggies, less fat, less meat, more whole grains, more organic food...  Sadly, that often limits lunch choices to grilled chicken salads.

Tree Hugger's has lovely, lovely soup, great vegetarian and chicken (with fruit!) salads.  I recently had the black bean chimichanga-- black beans, rice and sweet potato in spices wrapped in a whole wheat tortilla and grilled.  It wasn't meat and it wasn't fried, yet it still managed to taste fantastic!  The chicken salad wrap is delish, but it really does need salt.  (I actually appreciate that, though, because most places over-salt everything.)

Fear not the vegan cookie!  Vegan baked goods are usually disgusting.  Sorry guys, but that brownish lump of oats, hemp seeds, coconut and carob is just not appealing.  Tree Huggers has somehow managed to make vegan cookies that are as desirable as plain old cookies!!!  I had a carrot ginger cookie-- think of a light carrot cake with an orange ginger glaze.

They don't skimp on the cheese and the sauc is nummy too.  I got to try a couple of bites of the more exotic slices my co-workers got, such as chicken cordon bleu pizza and pesto pizza.  Plenty of options for vegetarians too.

I'd highly recommend this place for a cheap but delicious slice.  You'll have a hard time choosing your toppings....but that just means you'll have to go back again and again to try more!  I know next time I'm in Madison, I'll be back.",2008-11-10,Madison,-89.3869503096,43.0748916557,"['Restaurants', 'Italian', 'Pizza']"

1,Thai Gourmet,"This is NOT Thai food. I repeat, this is NOT THAI FOOD!
I ordered the pad thai for lunch this afternoon, 38 minutes ago to be exact. As a matter of fact, it's still sitting in front of me. Drenched in some sort of red/orange oil?
The chicken is dry and the shrimp might be composed of rubber. The fact that the name of this place is called ""Thai Gourmet"" is ridiculous. This is Chinese food with a lime tossed on it. 
I'm bummed that I paid $9 for a cup of ""pad thai"" and even tipped the man $2. I would have rather just thrown the money away.

Edit: I've actually thrown this away and ate Chef Boyardi for lunch. Which strangely tasted similar to the pad thai.",2012-05-29,Independence,-81.64192290000001,41.395817,"['Chinese', 'Thai', 'Restaurants']"
5,Moira Sushi,"I'm not one to go the traditional route. I prefer to pick several appetizers and add a few rolls when I am doing a sushi outing. OMG you have to have the Hama Chili, Crackling Calamari, Tuna Poke and Sunshine Roll. I love spice but when you pair it with grapefruit, anyone can take the heat on the Hama Chili. The Crackling Calamari isn't your vanilla appetizer you find elsewhere. Amidst the crispy tentacles, you have a treasure trove of Asian mushrooms, cabbage and crunchy textures that spoil your tastebuds. And if that isn't enough to have you lusting, the Tuna Poke is amaze balls. I love the rice crackers because it's the only way to ""permissibly"" allow you to scrape the bowl without looking like you lack etiquette. To cleanse your palate of the explosion of happiness erupting in your mouth, the Sunshine Roll is an delish crowd pleaser and closing for your tasting. For someone with a linebacker appetite, I have to admit I was very happily content. Happy belly happy face!!!!

From all the various Buddhas to the chainlink bathroom entrance, I love the setup because it immediately invites you in with the shimmering lights dancing above the bar and the dark decor to be flirtacious. And who can resist a big Asian DJ spinning the best 80s tunes as you down your cold saki to forget the hot days of summer ahead. Definitely making another trip back and will check out happy hour with my entourage. You will not regret it!!!

5,Archi's Thai Kitchen,"This place deserves 5 stars based on these 3 things:

1. AFFORDABLE PRICE: My parents, sister and I visited this place on a Sunday night while visiting Vegas for the weekend.  We ordered soup, pad thai, chicken larb, seafood salad, stuffed chicken wings, sticky rice, thai tea and thai iced coffee.  The total bill was $64!!!  $64 for a complete meal with soup, appetizers, sticky rice, drinks and noodles is pretty dang good!  Not only that, but the dishes weren't dinky and were plentiful!  The Thai Tea and Thai Iced Coffee also came in huge glasses. So much that my parents didn't finish their drinks and had to take it to go.  I'm used to a very fat bill with small portions every time I visit a Thai restaurant back home in California, so $64 looked great to us.

2. GREAT FOOD:  Not only was the place very affordable for a Thai Restaurant, but it was amazingly delicious.  BEST CHICKEN LAAB/LARB I EVER HAD IN MY LIFE! (From a restaurant, that is.  I still think Mom & Bro-in-law makes the best larb in the world).  It was a perfect combination of salty and sour.  I find that some restaurants make it too salty or don't add enough of that larb stuff..... rice powder/toasted rice powder.  I immediately tasted a hint of rice powder and asked my mom if she did too... just to confirm it.  They also added just enough cilantro and greens to add that fresh herb taste to it.  Everything was in perfect unison.  It was just damn PERFECT!

Everything else was great; Tom Yum Soup was flavorful, seafood salad was fresh, pad thai was also delicious and the sticky rice was heaven!  It was kept in a bamboo warmer and had that home quality taste just like the way Grandmas makes sticky rice.

We ordered a 4 spicy on a scale of 1-10 and it was just perfect.  It was pretty spicy for a 4, but it was just about right.  We got our pepper kick without totally burning off our tongues.  I come from a family that eats spicy food, so I recommend asking for 3 or lower if you can't really take the heat.  

3.  GREAT SERVICE:  I was put in charge of searching for restaurants to go to during our trip, so initially, I was thinking about taking my parents to a more fancier, ""Best Thai Restaurant in the Country"" place.  But last minute, I decided on Archie's because of the reviews that stated this place was a small, family owned restaurant.  Knowing my parents' preference and my own as well, I knew we would enjoy the food and atmosphere of a small restaurant.  The 2 waitresses were super friendly and often checked back on our tables to see if we needed anything else.  They also came back around to refill our water twice.

The only negative about Archie's is that it's away from the strip.  It's not too far, but its a few miles.  Also, the restaurant is located on a very dark shopping center.   The shopping center was deserted and.... kinda creepy.",2009-02-25,Las Vegas,-115.23097040000002,36.1148157,"['Restaurants', 'Thai']"
5,Rock Lobster,"Let me first say I've read a lot of reviews about the service. I've never gone to Rock Lobster for the teppanyaki so I cannot speak to that experience. However, the few times I have been there for lunch and dinner we were greeted by several people when we came in, our drinks were refilled regularly, the waiters asked if we had any questions about the menu, and they were happy to provide recommendations when we asked. I have never had a problem with the service. In fact, I've experienced a friendly, inviting environment. 

On an unrelated note, I recently discovered Rock Lobster's bento box lunches and I'm thrilled. They are affordable, fresh, and the perfect amount of food. So now this is also a favorite place to grab lunch. And I didn't mention this in my last review but I really like the unisex bathroom set-up. More places need to incorporate that into their design.",2016-01-15,Chandler,-111.88407250000002,33.2611752,"['Restaurants', 'Sushi Bars', 'Japanese', 'Asian Fusion', 'Teppanyaki']"
4,Monsoon Thai Cuisine,"I can't believe I haven't reviewed Monsoon before now, given how much we enjoy dining here - not least because it's within walking distance from our home, which makes for a nice last-minute dinner option when the cupboards are bare and we don't feel like driving to the store. 

The staff are always very sweet and willing to accommodate special requests, like my insistence for extra vegetables in whatever I'm ordering. They WILL make it super spicy if you are specific about asking for it - one time I received a dish of curry that looked like half a jar of chili pepper had been stirred into the sauce. Yowza! 

Their entree offerings are flavorful (anything with basil or Kaffir lime leaves is especially worth getting), varied, and typical for what you expect from a decent Thai place. I love pretty much any of the curries, and the option to order squid as your meat of choice is a nice addition to the usual beef/chicken/shrimp/scallop lineup. The Thai Iced Tea is a big winner with my husband - too sweet for me, but I always steal a sip regardless. Serving sizes are substantial - you could easily split a dish if you and your dining partner wanted to eat the same thing, but it'd also work very well if a group of friends wanted to order a few different things to serve up family-style.

Prices range on the slightly higher side for dinner fare (again, typical for what I've seen in other Thai restaurants), but their lunch menu is really bargain-priced. Most of Charlotte seems to know it, too, because it's always HOPPING during the times I've visited mid-day. Later in the evening, business seems to slow down - several times, my husband and I have been the only people in the restaurant. 

Honestly, we've not tried any other Thai restaurants in Charlotte yet, because we like this one so much and it's so close to home. Maybe we're missing out...but it sure doesn't feel like it.",2013-03-05,Charlotte,-80.8668329,35.199335999999995,"['Restaurants', 'Thai', 'Vegetarian']"

5,La Brioche True Food,"I really can't believe that I'm saying this, but I think Brioche has knocked out my #1 and is my new favorite restaurant in Madison. Come here for a true dining experience; you won't be disappointed.

We went for brunch and it was pretty busy, but we didn't have to wait for a table. I got the mushroom omelet and my friend got the veggie benedict. Both were tasty, as were the greens that came with it and the soup we got as an appetizer.

We had to try something from the bakery too, so after asking our waitress for her recommendation, we took a morning bun to go (they're known for them). Also great.

The thing that gets me about this restaurant is that it's not a dinner (or a lunch, brunch, etc.); it's an experience. Everything in the place has been thought out and made as comfortable as possible. For example, the entire restaurant has been designed with feng shui concepts (and is explained in a little book on the table!), they serve reverse-osmosis water that's made onsite, and they have table lamps at the smaller tables.

Seriously, Brioche, A+. I will be back again VERY soon.",2013-05-28,Madison,-89.43834605209999,43.075353530600005,"['Breakfast & Brunch', 'Pizza', 'Restaurants', 'American (New)']"

They have pizzas, meal-sized salads, sandwiches, and full entrees. I have had the steak and tomato salad three times, and each time it arrives a bit differently with meat of varying doneness.  They serve fried artichokes on top, which is perhaps the best part. 

Avoid the steak sandwich unless you want to eat it with a fork and knife, the meat is far too thick for chewing through and attempts at it make for a disgusting show of mastication for your dining partners.  The mac n cheese with dried porcini mushroom is a miss in my books - i felt like i had drank a cup of cream after - not enough depth of flavour.

We sit down at a table outside on the patio. Waiter comes up and I'm about to ask him about espresso drinks when he cuts me off and says something along the lines ""we just have regular American coffee, nothing fancy."" First of all, espresso is not fancy. Second of all, when you call yourself anything ""Italian"" and you don't have espresso you are a fraud. So needless to say after this ignorant waiter managed to piss me off by implying I'm pretentious for wanting ""fancy"" coffee I didn't get anything, my dad got one drink and we left. Also, some other table near us was just getting their pizza as we were leaving and it looked like awful, medium-thick crust, flavorless, frozen pizza. From the reviews on here that sounds about right. Seriously, just call the place ""bad American pizza.""

3,Bea Taco Town,"NOTE- this review is for the new Banksville location which does not have a yelp page as of yet.

Yesterday, I visited the brand brew Bea Taco Town located on Banksville road for their grand opening. I was originally intrigued to go as I had heard so many good things about their downtown location and because they had a sign stating that items were 50% off during their opening. 


I arrived around 1:30pm for lunch and it wasn't quite busy at that time, but did start to fill up as I was eating. Actually, by the time I left the entire place was full (there are two sides a small area with seating and also a larger main area). 

In general, the service was very fast and friendly and the food was okay- I had chicken enchiladas with red sauce and a side of rice and refried black beans. The beans were my favorite part and everything else was just okay, as mentioned. Not great, not bad,  just okay. Although, My fiancé had chicken and steak street tacos and he said he really enjoyed them and they were very fresh. 

The restaurant itself seems to be a mish mash of items from the previous restaurant that has been repurposed with new (bright orange and green) paint. Although, this eclectic type style may be what they're going for so I'm  not knocking them. 

One thing I didn't like was that the menus were paper copies that were handwritten, so it made it very difficult to read and interpret. I wish they would have just typed something up and printed those out. 

Overall my experience here was again just okay. Nothing bad happened but I wasn't really blown away. Finally, when the bill came the only items that were 50% off were the street tacos, not my meal, so I thought the sign they had out front was a bit contradictory. If you're going to run specials on select items you need to be more specific so that people's expectations of what they are paying is clear.",2016-02-28,Pittsburgh,-79.99732309999999,40.4424229,"['Restaurants', 'Mexican']"

5,Paul's Spaghetti,"Excellent food! Pretty good service.  Once when we went here for dinner we had to wait quite long for our main courses to arrive, other then that, I highly recommend this restaurant.

Everything is pretty much homemade...you can certainly tell from the taste.  My SO has had the Spaghetti w/Meatsauce which is(was) his favourite...it no longer appears on the menu(the last time we were there), but they now only offer Spaghetti w/Meatballs...which is also very good.
I've tried the gnocchi once and it was good but my favourite dish is the Rigatone w/Spinach (vegetarian), it is served with a creamy pesto sauce, onions(not a lot), spinach, goat's cheese crumbled on top and toasted pine nuts.  The first time I tried this, I thought I had died and gone to heaven--seriously!!  It is very rich and creamy, which I like and I love pasta.

I also recommend the house salad with a homemande vinagrette dressing to start, and they also bring you fresh baked warm bread w/butter.

Most (if not all) of the desserts are homemade...some on the premises and some offsite...I overheard the server talking to another table.

The patio is great in the summer.  The restaurant itself is quite small but a cozy, relaxing atmosphere.  I don't recommend bringing children here though...

Calamari was crisp. I was surprised it can be tasted that good with the hot peppers. Must try!

Steak tartare, a little bit dry but not too bad. I had better :)

Lobster crab cakes, not too special. $20 for only 2 pieces, I think you can skip it.  
 
We had the rib eye for main course, and the steak cooked to perfection with the fries on the side. One of the best steaks in town.

Also like their wine list. We ordered half bottle of red wine and it's enough for 2.

5,Phat Phrank's,"Excellent! Another bookmark down.

This review is long overdue. I had lunch here almost a month ago and I could not stop raving about it to coworkers when I got back. The experience is still fresh in my mind. I had the daily special Fish Tacos, but I asked for flour tortillas instead of corn. Everything was made fresh, and the slaw on my tacos was TO DIE FOR. The creamy sauce was perfectly seasoned and the fish was fresh and tasty. The rice wasn't mushy - it was cooked perfectly. My husband had a chicken burrito and he could not get over the salsa - he said it was the best salsa he had in his life.

Nestled behind a gas station and some heavy road construction, Phat Phrank's is a jewel in the rough. It's perfect for a power lunch, or maybe picking some to-go food when you just don't feel like cooking. 

As I sat there one random Friday afternoon, I had seen people from all walks of life come in and out happy. There were suits, construction workers, Louis Vuitton ladies, and families either dining in or picking up to go orders.

Frank was there during my visit and couldn't have been nicer. He made sure to talk to every customer and made sure everyone was enjoying their meal. He's super helpful when you're trying to figure out what you should order. I asked him why they weren't open on weekends and he had said they were once, but business wasn't worth a 7 day schedule. He did say once the construction on sunset was completed, they would definitely be open Saturdays again. 

Fresh food, great service, reasonable pricing - this place is an easy 5 stars.
As the unfortunate duchess of a certain Roberto's, I can proudly tell you that this place is definitely worth stopping by and checking it out !",2013-06-11,Las Vegas,-115.20688899999999,36.072516,"['Mexican', 'Restaurants']"

The food was decent, had the Vegas fries for an appetizer-which were spicy but in a good way and a nice decent portion. I ordered the brisket nachos which were awesome, however my boyfriend and his friend each ordered a sandwich and they were both small and left lots to be desired.

My problem with this restaurant was the service. It was slower than I've ever had, well ever. We asked for waters which didn't arrive until after our appetizer was half eaten (about 30 minutes from when we sat down) and we wanted to order alcoholic beverages but we barely saw our server after we ordered our appetizer and meals.

Recently this location was opened near me and I thought I would give it a shot. 
This time I tried the pulled pork and she had ribs.(Other times I had brisket)
The portions were a good size, a bit pricey, but expected in this area, 
The pork was cooked well and had nice texture and was fairly moist, but did lack smoke flavor. Overall not bad. The sides...beans were good, had some meat in them with onions and a nice flavor. The mac and cheese was ok, but not great. Kinda lacking flavor, but still edible. The ribs were good, not great, but a nice portion for a half rack. 
The service, not table side, was confused. I guess they are still learning. The people behind the counter seemed not sure what to do and were kinda falling over themselves. They ran out of mac and cheese and we had to wait til it came out of the oven. 
Overall, better that previous experiences. I really wish yelp allowed 1/2 stars cause they were a little better than 3, but I'll go a four since they are new as a benefit of the doubt on the service.",2016-10-23,Matthews,-80.7286189869,35.0829585488,"['Beer Bar', 'Bars', 'Sandwiches', 'Barbeque', 'Nightlife', 'Restaurants']"

The butternut squash soup is incredible!  I would highly recommend that to start.  I also had the watercress and cucumber salad which was also delightful and a nice light start to the meal.  I ordered the rack of lamb...rare.  It was incredible.  I did notice it was a little on the fatty side, but the cut was nice and big and it was so delicious, that no matter how full I felt, I had to finish it.  The table got quite a few sides...assorted mushrooms, pureed sweet potatoes, fingerling potatoes, asparagus and potatoes au gratin.  I wasn't a huge fan of the fingerling potatoes...it was just baked and lacked flavor.  The pureed sweet potatoes were my favorite with the asparagus a close second.  For dessert, you must get the Monkey Bread.  That was absolutely incredible.  I wasn't too fond of the pairing with the Brown Sugar Sour Cream ice cream, but a good vanilla ice cream would be great with the monkey bread.  The ambiance is great although I would do without the paintings of cows with a steak cut written on it.

3,Barrio,"They've got some typical new-restaurant issues with service;  my friend and I were handled by three different waiters/waitresses upon getting in there, which was a little disconcerting.   They all did alright, but it seemed like they were a bit panicky and overwhelmed, even though the restaurant wasn't full.  

The free chips and sals are definitely a plus.  The chips appeared to be house-made, and the salsa didn't taste like it was made of soup kitchen castoff veggies.  I was impressed, and I think between the two of us, we went through three bowls.  

I ordered chorizo tacos and fried fish tacos.  The chorizo was as expected (good and greasy with a healthy kick), but the fish tacos were great.  The batter wasn't too thick, and it didn't feel overcooked.  Yes, everything wasn't delivered to the table piping hot, but honestly, I'll have it that way instead of ""oh god why is my palate bleeding?"" hot.

4,Rosie McCaffrey's Irish Pub & Restaurant,"Oh boy was I excited when I first walked into Rosie McCaffrey's.  An Irish pub right down the street?  This place was a godsend disguised as a local drunken hotspot.

Apparently, it wasn't disguised at all.  It really is just a local drunken hotspot.

I've been a moderate patron of Rosies for the past few months now, and while this is my usual watering hole of choice, there are a few things that need to be said about it.  First of all, the beer selection is good.  It isn't Yardhouse by a longshot, but the choices are varied for different tastes and income brackets.  The food is good for bar fare.  I felt much like a Irish local grazing the fields of greasy confections, I could literally feel my alcohol tolerance increasing with each bite.  The service is good, but prepare to wait if the place fills up (which it does) and you'll get looked over if you don't have cleavage (which I don't) but it helps if you're on a first name basis with the staff (which I am).

The music is varied, which is nice.  On the nights where live music is playing, you'll get a spattering of Irish folk music or recent covers.  I'm a fan of a few bands that play there, but to be completely honest, there have only been a few occasions where I've found my toes tapping.  But it's lively and fun, pleasant to listen to while you inebriate yourself.

You'll find a wide range of characters that frequent Rosies, though.  From the bar rats, greased woman hunters, drunken floozies, haughty better-than-alls and down home boys, there is never a lack of people to talk to.  I can't guarantee a good experience, but who can?  But I wouldn't worry, if you're using the place as you should, you won't remember tomorrow morning anyway.

No matter it's flaws, Rosie McCaffery's is worth a visit at least.  Grab a bite, take a shot of Irish courage and mix it up with a stranger.  If you see a fellow standing to the side, people watching with a silent amused smirk, come and say hello.  I probably won't bite.",2007-12-19,Phoenix,-112.06144634700001,33.5094076522,"['Irish', 'Restaurants', 'Nightlife', 'Pubs', 'Bars']"

Although a chain, they did have both from San Tan Brewery and Four Peaks on tap. Two of each. A solid plus to the usual bud, bud-light, coors, coors light sameness.

My co-diner ordered a beer from the fairly large list and I ordered a glass of red wine; we were both pleased. And the food! I had the steak feature--a baseball sirloin with truffle butter and red wine jus accompanied by asparagus and frites. My steak was cooked perfectly (emphasis!) which isn't always the easiest with that cut and melted in my mouth. Both the asparagus and frites were solid too. It was a steal at $21. Co-diner ordered the burger feature and was also really impressed and enjoyed the house tomato-jalapeno jam. 

The excellent service and positive atmosphere lasted throughout the meal. The staff seem to really enjoy working there and ensuring patrons have a good experience.

4,Asian Legend,"I imagine ordering at Asian Legend for the first time is kind of like casting out a fishing net and seeing what you get...

They do some of the pseudo Chinese dishes though it's not their specialty, so if you're looking for Chicken w Cashews, Fried Rice, Sweet & Sour, etc, you may not be impressed.

But they do some ""Northern"" Chinese dishes consistently well which is hard to find in the city, even one as multicultural as Toronto. I say ""Northern"" Chinese but to me this type of food has always just been Chinese food but with so many different styles of Chinese food I guess they've had to define it as ""Northern"". Northern in this case I assume refers to Beijing though they have a wide selection of traditional Chinese dishes.

Now I'll be honest, I've had better food in Asia and if you're a purist then I'm afraid you'll not find a adequate substitute here but I've taken many people here from all cultures and they've always been happy with the food.

Plus they're one of the cleaner places in Chinatown which helps if you're entertaining and it's a fun place to bring larger groups and eat family style affordably. Tables of 10 welcome!

If you're looking for things to order here are my recommendations in order of amazingness:

Steamed pork soup dumplings (we usually come here just for this dish)
Rolled Onion Pancake with Sliced Beef
Sauteed Green Beans with Dried Shrimp (but I always ask for garlic instead of dried shrimp, I think they've actually changed it to garlic but haven't updated the menu)
Stir Fried Ho Fun w Beef
Moo Shu Chicken
Shredded Pork w Sweet Peking Sauce
Fried Tofu
And they do a decent peking duck which is always fun if you're with larger groups.

These are super safe dishes for those who are new to Chinese food. I'd imagine that if you're not, you'll probably know what to order on your own.

I've just realized that I usually go with non-Chinese people so I've actually not tried some of my favourite Chinese dishes like Dong Po Pork, Shredded Chicken w Noodles, Beef Noodle Soup, and Braised or Sauteed Eggplant. 

I'll have to make a point to try them next time and update accordingly... stay tuned...",2011-03-12,Toronto,-79.3951973,43.6538619,"['Restaurants', 'Dim Sum', 'Chinese']"
4,Hikari,"one thing you need to know: this place is only open for dinner on the weekends.  

now about the food....the sushi was good.  not the best, but it was good.  i really like that staff there. super friendly.  when you do AYCE, they let you order whatever you want, made however you want.  if you feel like extra masago, you can get extra masago.  if you want spicy mayo on sashimi with a lemon wedge, you can do that too.  you get the drift.  

you know how some AYCE places pack on the rice on their rolls and sushi, this place doesnt.  

also, i like the wide selection of appetizers.  

another useful tip, you can order 1/2 orders of the various rolls so you can have the freedom to sample ALL the rolls, like i do! =)

I was introduced to Rosati's at their store on Thomas in Central Phoenix.  They had a good variety of menu items, appitizers, ribs, fish and chips, fried shrimp, salad, sandwiches and pizza and pasta.  Then when my daughter and I stayed at a local hotel and didn't feel like going out, their store in Awhatukee delivered right to our hotel room door! Their pasta is always cooked to perfection.....my daughter loves her spaghetti with butter.  They give you a generous hunk of garlic bread with it.  I love pizza.....and this pizza was unique to me the first time I had it.  A thin crust, cut in squares, with the toppings covered by a layer of cheese.  YUM!  Apparently this is another type of Chicago style pizza.  Their toppins are quality!  The sausage is delicious!!  It's got the right amount of spices and that gives it a nice flavor.  So tonight I decided to try something a little different.  I ordered their ""double dough"" pizza.  It's a thicker crust but not a super thick crust.  The edges are thicker than the regular pizza they serve.  This was the BOMB DIGGITY!  I had sausage, pepperoni, mushrooms and roasted red peppers and that was an awesome combination.  I also had the freshest ceaser salad I have had in a while.  Friday night is pizza night at our house and this one will be in the rotation for sure!

4,Five Guys Burgers and Fries,"Five Guys is definitely a unique fast food experience. 

When you walk in, the restaurant is very open. I personally really like that. However,
some people (my other half) don't like the openness. It lacks privacy. It's more of a cafeteria style dining room setup. It's reminiscent of a mall food court.

I think that Five Guys has a really efficient system to making their food, which leads to few screw ups. Big plus. You can see the entire process of your food being made from start to finish. This reflects the transparency of Five Guys. They are open and transparent about everything. That's their gimmick - that there is no gimmick.  You order at the register and pick up on the other side after it's done. Food can take a little longer to come up than most places, but that's because they're making everything fresh. 

Their burgers are made fresh of a good quality beef. This isn't your ordinary fast food burger. The toppings are always fresh. There's a sign that tells you the farm where today's potatoes for the french fries come from. The french fries are (obviously) fresh cut (they literally keep their dated sacks of potatoes in the dining room). They're also fried in peanut oil, which gives them their unique flavor. Most places avoid peanut oil because of the common and deadly peanut allergy (obviously if you have any serious nut allergies, this place is not for you). But the peanut oil gives the fries a little something different that you can't get most places. They also offer Cajun seasoning for the fries. They're alright, but lack luster. They're more of just a hot spice than a flavorful spice, which disappointed me.

The food is definitely greasy, which puts some people off, but what would you really expect from a place like this? It's served in a brown paper bag, and your fries will be everywhere. Be warned. For some people that's a major annoyance/turn off, but it doesn't bother me any. 

The staff is always very friendly and polite. They all always have smiles on their faces. 

The price is a little steep for what it is. That's what knocks it down to four stars instead of five for me. It's also nothing super unique or special. That's another reason to knock the fifth star off. But the food is fresh, and the employees are friendly. For most places that's half the battle. 

Helpful hint: a ""little"" burger is a single party. If you order a hamburger cheeseburger, it's going to have two patties.",2015-02-24,Pittsburgh,-80.17491892529999,40.448708349899995,"['Restaurants', 'Burgers', 'American (New)', 'Fast Food']"

I usually start with the mixed ceviche which is pretty good although I've had better. It serves to fill my craving until I can get the real deal!
The carne asada is my go to dish and it comes with rice and beans, plantain, and a salad. They do allow you to modify the sides and I recommend the sweet plantain and change to the avocado salad.

2,Hogtown Smoke In The Beach,"I ordered the Carolina Pulled pork sandwich which came with your choice of 2 sides, I chose the mac and cheese and fries, as well as pig candy for delivery through Just-Eat. The sandwich said it came topped with coleslaw, I assumed there would be somekind of bbq sause on the actual pulled pork. But no, it was DRY. The taste was fine, but I've never heard of a dry pulled pork sandwich and I would have appreciated a note to inform me to choose the sauce separately. The coleslaw was fairly bland and soggy as well. The fries were almost black, soggy, and a few were actually under cooked. The mac and cheese was edible. The pig candy (chocolate covered bacon) wasn't good. The bacon itself was good, thick cut and cooked to chewy not cripsy, which is how I prefer it but the taste if the chocolate wasn't good and didn't pare well with the bacon. I realize that the delivery could have caused some of the sogginess but I doubt it. I get delivery often and am always trying new places, so I like to think I'm a pretty good judge of when the food itself is an issue and when it's the delivery process that causes the problems. The total including a $5 delivery tip and $3.99 delivery charge came to just shy of $40. Not even close to worth it.",2015-06-04,Toronto,-79.3021431193,43.6695491216,"['Restaurants', 'Barbeque']"

I wouldn't recommend it for people who are actually hungry. $8.00 for a sandwich seems like you're getting a deal in Vegas but you're not. You will be in search of more food after.

I was delighted to see that Amaya's served a roti which sounded delicious:  spinach, edamame, sweet potato and spicy mayo. I ordered samosas and pakoras which were pretty tasty. The roti though was a disappointment. I neglected to notice that it had said ""roti wrap"" so the ""wrap"" was just a tortilla wrap. Not a nice, chewy, light roti shell like they make at Ghandi's & Mother India. It felt like I was just eating an indian wrap sandwich. 
The filling tasted pretty decent so I might give this place another chance but try their curries.  I'm more inclined to just try the restaurants that I haven't been to yet in Little India because the prices are better there.

4,Fired Pie,"I stopped in at lunch time after seeing this place on the ""new businesses"" section on the Yelp homepage.  The map seems to be off, this place is located next to the AMC 30 and Starbucks at the Deer Valley Town (Towne?) Center.  I was reluctant at first because the only other pizza joint like this I had tried before in North Phoenix (I forget the name) missed the mark pretty bad (over priced and not filling).

The set up is straight forward, any pizza or salad is $7.75.  They have a few pre-built options, otherwise you can build your own.  I went the build your own route and rattled off a few of my go-to toppings. There was plenty more options and it would be nice if there were labels or a cheat sheet as I might want to get a little more adventurous in the future. I didn't feel like being the ""what's that?...and that?...and that?"" guy.

The pizza itself took only a few minutes to cook and seemed to be just about the right size for a lunch portion (I could have saved a bit for later but was exceptionally hungry). The staff was very helpful and friendly, and after reporting back to folks at the office I'm sure I'll be returning sometime in the near future.",2013-08-26,Phoenix,-112.124353,33.666693,"['Italian', 'Restaurants', 'Salad', 'Pizza']"

3,Zee Grill Seafood Restaurant & Oyster Bar,"Came here because it was on some good seafood restaurant list. Atmosphere was lovely and cozy and service was really good. The appies of crab cakes were good and the carpaccio was also good. The special main course of scallops were ok nothing special (would eat again but don't crave for it). The dessert of lemon meringue ice cream sandwich was pretty and tasty according to my friend (I don't like meringue). But what turned us off big time was that the service was good until the moment you're done eating and then it became a passive aggressive act until we left. I haven't seen my friend in almost 2 months so we were catching up and talked after our meal. We didn't ask for the bill but it came immediately. We didn't pay yet but a lady came to stand next to our table with the machine. I asked if she can split the food so half on everything except dessert on my friends bill. She looked like she didn't understand so I elaborated. Eventually she says, ""so. You want separate bills?"" With attitude After I spent 2 minutes explaining the definition of what separate bills means and what goes onto what. She comes back and we pay and still give the appropriate tip. Then we continue to talk and I finished my glass of water but my friend hasn't. The lady comes takes my one glass away. I've been looking at the entrance there were NO ONE waiting. Yes it was busy maybe 90% full on a Saturday evening. Anyway then 5 mins later she comes picks up my napkin. Then my friend finishes her water and the server came to take her one glass. Then later lady comes back to take her one napkin. Again we stayed 20-30 mins after our meal was done and there were no one in line. with the price and ok food I would say it's an ok but nice restaurant but after this service post meal, we won't come back and don't recommend that you do either, there are too many nicer seafood places in Toronto.",2017-01-17,Toronto,-79.3887615,43.7049064,"['Restaurants', 'Seafood', 'American (New)', 'Canadian (New)']"
5,Spinato's Pizza,"Mama Spinato's Signature Fresh Spinach Pizza is one of the most perfect meals you can find in the Valley.

Spinato's sauce is really what hits the spot. It's slightly sweet. The fresh garlic on this pizza catches you by surprise and keeps you coming back for more.

If I could give Spinato's an extra star, I would. And it would be for the following: If you eat in the restaurant, the pizzas are served on top of a cooling rack, on top of a pizza pan. This ensures proper air circulation to the crust. By the time you get to that last slice of pizza (and trust me, there will be no leftovers to speak of) the crust still holds up to the pile of fresh spinach which sits atop it!

I know it's in a seemingly bland industrial park, but I promise you that there is nothing bland about the food. This will be a family favorite for as long as it exists.",2009-08-20,Tempe,-111.89997,33.4276,"['Restaurants', 'Pizza', 'Italian', 'Gluten-Free']"

And I would defy anyone eating the tacos blindfolded to be able to tell they were fish. I should have sent them back as they clearly were NOT made to order but rather were probably just sitting around under a heat lamp. The place was not busy, so there is no excuse. I ate them and got out, still hungry. Prices have gone up (fish tacos now are $2 and others are $1.25), which is understandable with all the hype. But to get full, you would have to eat at least half a dozen. Seriously, Rubios fish tacos, on special on Tuesdays for $1.50 are better, both taste-wise and money-wise.

I was wondering if there would be a difference in the food and service from the Universal location, but there wasn't.  The food was just as amazing as ever and the staff was extremely nice.

The mac and cheese is probably some of the best I have had since moving to Charlotte. The sweet potatoes surprised me. I typically enjoy them okay, mostly around holidays or in a pie or simply baked, but these bad boys right here - they were delicious and I couldn't stop eating them.  I really also enjoyed the cabbage but would pass on the greens.

The fish was pretty good, not the best I have ever had but it was pretty tasty none the less. And I really enjoyed their pig feet, trotters, whatever you want to call them. They were very tender and soft. The fried chicken wings were on point.

My husband and I went there for our anniversary. Arrived there as the first patron. Perfect for picture taking opportunity (especially for the untouched bread, dessert, and a mound of butter.....yet). We were seated in the garden area, a bit more secluded and private. Loved the ambiance and the decor (call me cheesy, but I love anything purple). The service was impeccable. I knew right away what I wanted, Sixteen Course Degustation Menu, without even opening the menu. My husband ordered Four Course Menu. Still skeptical about how magnificent the food was, I was both nervous and excited.  I knew then why people pay such a top dollar to go this place when I ate the first thing they served, Le Caviar (Caviar on a fennel cream). Just the fist bite of it and I am a changed foodie.

4,Lager & Vine,"The pluses:
* The only place I know of in Medina to have valet (I could be wrong but I haven't seen it anywhere else since Thyme moved).
* One of the few places in Medina that takes reservations.
* The Caprese Salad was really good, and that's saying a lot for tomatoes in winter in Ohio.
* Some unique options on draft. Not often you find Victory Golden Monkey on tap around here.
* Entrees were yummy - I had a burger (it was huge!) and my fiancee had a seafood pasta. We both enjoyed the meal.
* Not overly pretentious. Lots of differently dressed people, atmosphere is nice (think: rustic), without being stuffy.
* Servers (bartenders and our dinner server) were friendly, had a good sense of humor, and made some solid recommendations.

The minuses:
*  If you DON'T have reservations, expect a long wait, especially since people are coming in droves to try it out. TIP: Seating in the immediate bar area (all the hi-top tables) is first-come, first served.
* If you don't valet, it may be a challenge to find a parking spot.
* Prices are not bad, but higher than others in this city. Remember, the first location is in Hudson, and everything is priced higher there. :)
* If you're out for a family dinner with kids, not sure this is the place, unless it's maybe a weeknight dinner.

Overall - I enjoyed it. I have a goal to avoid ""big chain"" locations this year at all costs, so I can see this being a regular addition to our restaurant location. I'm not going for 5 stars since the reservation/parking issue kind of irks me (essentially, if you don't have a reservation, they make one for you at a later time).",2014-01-20,Medina,-81.863411,41.139364,"['Wine Bars', 'Restaurants', 'Bars', 'Gastropubs', 'Nightlife']"

Even when she is super busy, she will make it a point to stop by our table to catch up for a minute. 

The prices are beyond reasonable, especially for downtown. I love getting grilled cheese and tomato soup. But, hands down, the best thing they serve is the Friday mac and cheese. I have never found mac and cheese anywhere that comes close.  First of all, the cheese is flourescent orange, and the burned pieces from the sides of the pan, if you are lucky enough to get a little, cooks into a sort of cheese jerky that is actually delicious!

3,Genghis Grill,"I'm really frustrated with this place.  It's one of my teenager's favorite places to eat, but my experience yesterday will keep me away for quite awhile.  We've eaten here many times because...

My kid loves buffets where he can pile up on the limited amount of foods he likes. For example, at sub sandwich shops, he only has meat, lettuce and cucumbers on his bread.  Boring!  At Genghis grill he piles on the meat and adds broccoli an almost no sauce. He loves the Udon noodles.  I like the place too.  I make a mess every time (meaning I mix all the wrong things together) but I'm happy to do it.  I think the food is really tasty in spite of my culinary challenges.

I love the idea of this place, with TVs all around, and a full bar.  Unfortunately the execution falls a bit short with the TVs too high near the ceiling to be comfortable to watch for even a meal's worth of time.  The only TV I could see yesterday had a ceiling fan right in front of it.  The drinks are pretty pricey too, so there's better places to hang nearby if you want to watch a game (which I wanted to yesterday).

Now on to the service...  I don't like these semi-service deals where they bring you drinks and your check.  Am I supposed to tip them the full 15-20% like a regular restaurant?  If so, WHY?  Anyway... the gal who helped us was really short with us when we showed her my Yelp discount on my phone.  Yes, I showed her when she brought me the check, but I checked in on Yelp when I finished eating.  I hadn't asked for the check, so I don't think she should have had any attitude.  Then the thing that really sealed the deal was that I forgot my leftover box on the table (yes, I'm to blame here) but I barely made it to my car in the parking lot when I discovered it.  I was maybe 10 spaces from the door.  I actually jogged back to the restaurant and went to my table and everything was gone.  Everything was thrown out in 2-3 minutes from getting up from the table.  I had more than half my meal in there (it was full) and nobody even tried to holler at me.  They could have seen me out the front door all the way to my car.  I'm pretty sure it was my server who did it too because I found her and asked and she said YES it's been thrown out.  She acted a little sorry but I think she was happy to have ""gotten me"" for pulling up a coupon late.  So I left pissed off.  I got to my car and decided to call the manager.  I got the number and got him on the phone.  To his credit he offered to make me a new meal, but I was already down the road and didn't want to get out in the AZ heat one more time.  I didn't want free food.  I feel like taking free foods discredits the complaint to some degree.  I want to be treated better in the future.  Hopefully he spoke to her.  Grrrr... still irritated the next day.  

I'd give lower than 3 stars, but it was just one 1 star day out of many visits.  I'd have given them 4 stores before today.",2014-09-08,Glendale,-112.21723970000001,33.638668599999995,"['Restaurants', 'Mongolian', 'Chinese', 'Thai', 'Vegan', 'Vegetarian', 'Asian Fusion']"
5,The Wigwam,"See my review on trip advisor. I came for business, brought my 4yr old and 2yr old. Never a dull moment.  So many activities for the kids. The property is amazing. I have no complaints.  My kids did not complain at all during our week long visit. Ate at Red's,  flavors were on point! My daughter woke up wanting to go to the pool. Everyone was helpful and smiling.  I felt comfortable and safe here. They have holiday lights up through the the resort. I took my kids on a walk every night.  I really enjoyed myself here. Tim and Christine were two people who took the time to stop me and ask about my stay and if there was anything they could do, of course there wasnt!  I was having a blast!! Thank you and I can't wait to come back!

Take the time to explore inside and out. You will not regret it. Wish I could of ate at Litchfield s but, with the little ones I didn't get a chance. Maybe next time.

Forgot to mention i was traveling from California i was very tired and so were my little ones. I arrived at 1 pm and tried my luck to see if i could check in early. Yay i was able too! Not a problem. Also after eating at some great restaurants including reds on site, I had left over and requested a microwave which was brought promptly.

They said they saw where we were sitting and would come by after serving the cokes and waters to the other table. After 10 more minutes of waiting we decided to leave. I walked right by the waitress and she didn't say anything - no sorry, no please stay, no nothing. I can't rate the food cuz I never had a chance to order any.

3,Monsieur B,"C'était notre 2ème fois à ce restaurant. J'en avais tellement gardé un bon souvenir il y a un an... Mais  nous étions déçus... Il y avait deux grandes tables avec un souper de fêtes. Et ils faisaient TROP de bruit! Style bar sportif! Cris, tombola (!!!!), tapage sur la table! Ça détruit toute l'ambiance d'un petit resto qui est censé être charmant! Les serveurs s'excusaient mais ne pouvaient rien faire! Est-ce en même temps l'endroit pour accueillir ce genre d'événements!? 

Venons au menu. Nous avons pris le menu 6 services. Je suis enceinte et j'ai demandé au serveur s'il est possible de changer mes bouchées de thon et saumon crus en autre chose. Parfait! Mais, le chef change les bouchées pour TOUTE la table et on nous ramène des crevettes et des moules frites! Pas du tout original! C'était surtout un peut injuste par rapport aux 3 autres personnes avec moi! 

La soupe du jour était brocoli et panais. Un délice! Bien relevée et crémeuse! Dommage qu'elle n'a pas été bien mixée : des bouts de panais trop durs restaient en bouche... 

Mon entrée était très bonne : gnocchi de courges. Le plat, pintade farci, était une déception! À part la polenta frite qui était délicieuse et les petits pois frais, tout était moyen, voire mauvais. La purée fade, la sauce Madère trop acide, mais surtout la pintade, TROP grasse, je ne l'ai pas mangé : après avoir gouté un petit bout que j'ai eu du mal à couper avec mon couteau, je l'ai laissé sur l'assiette... Le trou normand était bon et bien rafraichissant. 

Le dessert, pana cotta, était excellent! Je l'ai littéralement dévoré! Les saveurs équilibrés et la texture de la crème parfaite! 

En résumé, l'ambiance trop énervante et une volaille à la fois sèche et trop grasse ; une entrée originale et un dessert trop bien exécuté.",2017-01-15,Montréal,-73.586277,45.525025,"['Restaurants', 'French']"

ambiance: 4 stars - was a bit loud for my preference. Definitely better on the dining room side than the bar side, but if there's a big group of people dining at a table, it gets louder than I typically like. also, good idea to make a reservation. 

service: 5 stars, just the right balance of attentive without interfering or being annoying. 

appetizers: 5 stars. we had the heirloom tomato salad and the chicken liver mouse. both outstanding. 

entrees: 4 stars. we had the Tagliatelle and the crispy chicken. both dishes i found a bit too salty. we both felt the appetizers were the winners over the entrees.

cocktails: 4.5 stars - delicious, but wish there was a larger menu.

2,Spinato's Pizzeria,"What a joke!   Their food is good. But the service I just had for lunch was atrocious.   Ordered my food with an iced tea.    Received the ice tea at the bar and then had to ask the bartender for sweetener.    As I looked around the place was nearly empty.   The bartender walks away and I don't see him for another 5 minutes or so.     My iced tea was empty after two minutes and when I looked around for someone to give a refill.   Surprise.  No one is around.    I had to wait until my food arrived from it looked like a cook to get a refill from someone other than the bartender.   Of course with no ice in it.    Nice room temperature to it.   He also had to get me silverware. 
Frankly I was less than impressed with the service.    It wasn't until halfway done with my meal that the bartender comes by with a cup of ice and a spoon to tell me. The ice melts fast.    Gee.  I think it really melts fast when their is no ice in the refill cup too.   

I am only giving two stars for the food which I believe is 4+ stars.   I am going to stick with delivery and takeout.    If you want to get better service go next door to the Persian restaurant.

1,Hugo's Cellar,"I was walking along Fremont when I saw this place on yelp.

I came downstairs after grabbing a pint upstairs at the Chicago Brewing, I wasn't acknowledged by Richard right away, a couple that came in after me was seated first (I'll dismiss this because they likely had reservations and I did not).

The server Jean(Gene?) and his assistant and the food was top notch and attentive the whole evening.  my main issue is with the manager and host - Richard, who is a pompous bigot. I encourage if anyone has any issues with Richard to report it to the hotel management, I wouldn't be surprised if your skin is dark or if you're not as well dressed that he will tell you the tables are full from reservations or treat you similarly.

There are no restrooms in the restaurant, so you need to go out and to the casino floor, Jeans assistant gave me brief and accurate directions and I returned to find a fine glass of Moscato waiting for me which I ordered to pair with the escargot, which I might add was the best I had since Paris.

The salad was custom crafted and the rack of lamb was cooked exactly as requested

I tried to go to the bathroom a second time after getting my lamb, and then Richard blocked my way, he insisted that I must leave a credit card before leaving, even though I left and returned before, as well as I had left personal items, including my phone, in plain site on the table.  It was clear that Richard was profiling me because he thought I was of lesser class. 

I am absolutely insulted.

I gave my card frustratingly and returned to finish my meal, the hostess that seated me originally apologized for Richards behavior and ignorance, I asked Jean if Richard had a manager I could speak with but was told unfortunately that he was the manager and I had no point of escalation. Jean also apologized for Richards behavior, it seems I'm not the only one he mistreats.

I finished my meal, and I thought I would go to the floor quick and drop $5 in the slots while I let my dinner settle as my phone battery was low and I was catching a redeye out that evening, since I had plenty to drink already I brought my water, again leaving personal items on the table.  Richard again blocked me this time and insisted I must leave the glass, not asking where I was going or if I'd return, I felt like dumping the water on his head but unfortunately couldn't without possibly getting a customer wet.

When I returned, my table was cleared, obviously they don't want me eating their wonderful selection of dessert, and Richard had Jean's assistant clear my table, he apologized for this and I could feel it was sincere, I never received a single apology from Richard, hence the label pompous bigot.",2015-05-14,Las Vegas,-115.142535036,36.1695017335,"['Restaurants', 'Seafood', 'Steakhouses', 'American (New)', 'American (Traditional)']"

3,Tex Mex 2,"We needed margaritas. 

And boy did we get them! This place does great margaritas, in a range of different flavours (most of which I have sampled) and they're not too heavy on the tequila, so you don't up in the bathroom crying before 10pm.

There was a large(ish) group of us and I must say it was nice of them to accommodate us. It's not a big place! We took up two tables but thankfully, the staff had moved the tables so that we could all see each other. We ordered a sharing plate of nachos to start and they were delicious. Everyone commented on how, amongst the mounds of toppings, the butternut squash was an odd but tasty addition. For main I ordered the Tex Mex Burger. I was disappointed it didn't come with chips but the burger was really good and the sour dough bun in particular was lovely.

This would be 5stars but.....well, when a restaurant says they close at 10 I always assume that refers to the kitchen. This place actually tries to get you to leave at 10. By 10:10 we were feeling a little awkward but still had almost a full pitcher of margarita left. Then the waiter did something which goes against my (unwritten and constantly changing) 'restaurant rules.' He brought over the bill before we asked. I find this quite rude. He could have asked if we wanted the bill first! A minor thing but it would have made all the difference.

Then...he broke another two rules! We totted up the notes and coins and I brought the total up to him, I was paying by card so while we went through the motions I explained that I didn't realise the place would actually close at 10 and apologised for my oversight (it was about 20 past at this stage) he said it was fine but made a song and dance about how much work he still had left to do. Fine, message received. I handed him the cash and returned to my seat. When he hadn't brought the change after 10minutes we resigned to just leave, we'd intended leaving it as a tip anyway (maybe he'd heard us discussing it) but I made a point of 'asking if it was all there' (I'm Irish, I don't do full confrontation well) he said yes and gave me the thumbs up.

Now, this is getting very long, but between bringing over the bill, complaining about how much work he still had to do and not returning the change, I must say, this was not the kind of service I was expecting. In my opinion we weren't drunk, loud or obnoxious but past 10 pm everyone at the table was left feeling awkward to the extent that most won't be returning.

It's unfortunate because the food is fantastic and the margaritas pretty darn good too.",2013-01-17,Edinburgh,-3.1998917999999996,55.953802100000004,"['Mexican', 'Restaurants', 'Tex-Mex']"

It's basically the same concept as Pieology, a make your own bar full of pizza toppings.  You can choose from the menu of pre-made pizzas or create your own pizza from the many toppings they have.  I really don't know how to differentiate this place from the bigger pizza chains like Pieology and Blaze Pizza, because honestly, they're basically the same thing.  I will admit that I did enjoy the pre-made pesto pizza they listed on the menu.  It had a pesto base (no tomato sauce) topped with mozzarella cheese and chicken and tomatoes amongst other things.  I like this compared to the Pieology pesto pizza because from what I remember, the pesto is an after topping but is pretty liquidy and not as garlicky as the pesto pizza from Fired Pie.",2017-01-12,Chandler,-111.89050490000001,33.3202869,"['Pizza', 'Restaurants', 'Gluten-Free', 'Salad']"

I initially walked by this place doing some sight seeing and thought it was this run down restaurant. I mean, with a sign outside that says, ""Best Chicken in Taiwan,"" what was I to think? How shocked I was when I looked it up online and read the reviews. I decided I had to try this Hot Star out. 

Stopped in around 1PM on a Friday. There were a few people inside already, and went up to the counter to order. The cashier told me they weren't open yet, but would be in ten minutes. Cut to 40 minutes later, when I finally ordered. Their menu is still extremely limited: regular chicken, crispy chicken, spicy chicken, fries, and a few drinks/juices. 

The restaurant is small and new, but poorly designed. There are maybe 10 seats in the place, with an entire wall covered in a wood paneled design - should have made more seating there. But it's a piece of chicken that you can walk with, so no big deal there. 

The chicken? It's huge. It's fried. It's crispy. It's delicious. Like other people have said, it is just a piece of fried chicken, so it's not something totally new.

My friend and I specifically came here to sit on the patio. Specifically. We let the front desk person know, who said it would be a 20 min wait and gave us a buzzer. No problem. We sat at the bar and ordered drinks and some apps.

Let's talk about the drinks and food first - it came out quickly, so we were off to a good start. However, the raspberry mojito tasted like watered down syrup without an ounce of alcohol. The second drink, Unusual suspect, a bourbon concoction was actually good - a glimmer of hope. The flatbread apps were... meh. 

Okay, 40 minutes later, our buzzer hadn't lit up so we asked one of the servers to follow up on our patio request. Never came back. Another 40 minutes later - we were done our food and drinks, and still no buzzing! In fact, our server just took the buzzer with her when she cleared our plates.

I was bummed. Really. Especially because I was treating my friend to her birthday and we just wanted to enjoy drinks on the patio.

They have quite a variety of tacos to choose from. They costed around 4.50 each. They accept only cash and debit. They have a few sauces for you to pick from at the counter to put on your taco separately. 

Maybe I'm not a taco expert but I didn't find the tacos particularly special. I thought they were alright, has quite a bit of seasoning and really messy to eat lol, prepare to grab lots of napkins. The waiting time for the tacos felt like it took foreverrrrr. The two tacos were pretty big in portion I think and it was enough to fill me up.

5,Social House,"5 stars across the board . . . My 5-star reviews are few and far between these days, particularly because many of the restaurants I've visited in the past few months have missed the mark in some way or another.  Social House provided that rare experience that combines the best of ambiance, food and service. 

The modern restaurant is visually stunning from the moment you first walk into the lounge area and then sashay up to the host table. We had made a last minute Open Table reservation on a Friday night, and we were seated as soon as we came in. I loved the set up of the restaurant. First, they put us in the back area, but it was a little too dark for my taste, so we asked if we could have one of the booths in the front section. They were so accommodating, and said we would love this new table as it gave us a view of everyone who parades by. And it sure did! I am 100 percent sure my husband was the oldest person in the restaurant, and even being 16 years his junior, I am about 80 percent sure that I was the next oldest. But it sure was fun people watching . . . bachelor and bachelorette parties galore with some of the most interestingly dressed and entertaining people gliding by us.

Our server was fabulous! The menu offers so many wonderful options and he helped guide us through the choices, pointing out the fabulous and steering us away from the ordinary. We started with the Yellowtail Jalapeno. Don't be put off thinking it might be too spicy . . . it's not . . . a perfect melding of flavors with the tender Yellowtail and the crunchy jalapeno in a cilantro soy base. Next up . . . the salmon tartare, which was my favorite. The combination of the fresh and silky salmon layered with wasabi cream and drizzled with citrus soy was heavenly . . . so much so that I ordered another just for myself while hubby was licking his chops -- literally -- the tender Kurabuta Pork Ribs smothered in a sweet soy glaze were falling off the bone. We then shared the Cod Bibb Lettuce Cups . . . while we loved the dish, we found this a little skimpy for the price with only two pieces. As I was getting quite full, I opted to order only the roasted miso eggplant which put the finishing touches on my great meal.. My hubby with his big appetite ordered the hangar steak with roasted shallots and more of that delectable wasabi cream sauce. From pig heaven to cow heaven!

Social House is totally a hip place, even for us not-so-hip middle-agers. We had a fantastic meal, conscientious service and ""free"" entertainment. No doubt we will make another trip to Social House on our next trip to LV.

4,Gusto 101,"The Good: Everytime I come here, it's with the intention to order their house wine. Yes, admittedly, the $1 per ounce had me sold when I first found out about it over the summer, but their food is another reason for saving my appetite so I can order one of their well prepared dishes.

Must seat yourself on their patio when it's good weather. It can get a bit loud and crowded inside on their busy nights. 

On my last visit, I shared the following:

- Tagliata di Manzo - flank steak was cooked perfectly (medium rare) and flavourings were lovely.
- Branzino alla Griglia - the mix of veggies and fish was well done. Sea bass tasted fresh and juicy.
- Green tea gelato - sweet ending to the the dinner.
- each had a glass of house wine - white always crisp and it was perfect for sitting upstairs on their patio. 


The Bad: The Green tea gelato would've been perfect if the cookie that came with wasn't stale.

Service really needs some improvement. While the ladies at the front who seat us have been generally helpful, the servers really can do for some more genuine smiles. I understand that this place gets busy pretty much every night, but waiting for someone to put in our order or in one instance, basically cutting off my friend when she was deciding on what drink to order by saying, ""I'll just come back when you've decided."" was a bit rude in my opinion.


The Overall: Service aside, the food and drinks were great. Reasonably priced for a resto in the King District and conveniently located so you can always hit up another bar/club after.


Revisit: This is my go to place for drinks especially since it opens till 1am on Fri & Sat. How can you argue with $1/ounce wine? I would try having a get-together in their celler room.",2013-09-21,Toronto,-79.400309337,43.6450021311,"['Restaurants', 'Italian']"

4,Reds Midtown Tavern,"I'm a fan of the Reds in the financial district and last night, I found myself at the midtown location for the first time.  The service was lovely and attentive, no complaints there.  I ended up ordering off of the summerlicious menu b/c some of the offerings looked delicious.

I started with the quinoa salad with apples and aged cheddar.  This was fantastic - completely exceeded my expectations.  For my main, I ordered a fried chicken dish with beet/cauliflower  salad and this spicy chili sauce.  It was SO spicy, which I enjoyed, but I can imagine it being way too hot for the average person.  The chicken was incredible.  The other 7 people at my table opted for the steak or fish, and many were jealous of my pick.  For dessert, the chocolate pot de creme with chili was a bit of a let down.  Could not taste the chili at all.

I think Reds is simply a good option, anytime.  It's a great place to go if you want food that is a bit more inventive without being too out there.  I love the decor - the glass, leather and wood.  It's really pretty, but not dainty.",2015-07-09,Toronto,-79.3821131,43.6590888,"['Bars', 'Seafood', 'Wine Bars', 'Nightlife', 'Breakfast & Brunch', 'American (Traditional)', 'Canadian (New)', 'Restaurants']"

Their milk tea is tasty and the food is above average. Nothing that will knock your socks off but that's hard to find at establishments like these. 

I've had a few things from their menu, and today I tried to Korean style pork chop cutlet with rice. The pork chop was fried really well, a nice light batter and not oily at all. I really enjoyed it. Came with a soup and tea. 

The pricing is on par with other HK style cafes, but you also get a free newspaper if you're into that. Lots of competition in the area, so I expect them to remain competitive and provide decent service.",2017-01-11,Markham,-79.2836865,43.867917999999996,"['Chinese', 'Restaurants']"

4,Yummy Grill & Sushi,"Yummy Grill & Sushi surprised me... for a few reasons..

The name for one, since a name like Yummy grill & sushi would have caused me to run away in my local homeyelptown.

But this place is awesome, like me and the BF were saying that Toronto needs a Yummy Grill & Sushi bar. 

They offer fresh sashimi, and they specialize in rolls, as well as deep fried or baked rolls on top of everything else they offer. They seem to like the ponzu soy sauce quite a bit too, but it's not a bad thing.

Their roll names are pretty fanciful, such as Sex on the Beach (really good, I recommend), My Ex-Girlfriend, Romeo.. I know it sounds odd, but I almost burst out laughing when I heard a kid ask the waiter if he could have an orgasm roll... but it's good to know that they take their sushi rolls seriously. 

Their menu is fairly easy to navigate, we ordered their clam miso soup, which was meaty came loaded with clams, which added a nice meaty-ness depth to the miso soup, good value for $3.50

We started off with a Joy, bam-bam, and finished with the Sex on the Beach roll, all of which were fresh and extremely flavourful without being too much of one thing or another, you were able to taste everything they had put in to the roll and it wasn't too overly stuffed.

Another thing they have that i haven't seen anywhere else, was their flavoured-sake--- this stuff is good.  We ordered their sake sampler $7 for 3 decent sized glasses of sake, we were able to try fuji apple, plum and raspberry. I definitely liked their fuiji Apple one the best, and the BF liked the plum. The sake tasted like sake, but you get the aroma and the taste of the fruit at the same time, quite enjoyable and a steal $7. They, also, sell sparking sake too; which I didn't see until too late, but that is for next time...

Their black sesame ice cream is quite good, and isn't too sweet either. Perfect ending to pretty note-perfect meal.

Side dishes are good, about 5-6 varieties, the usual sprouts, kimchi, pancake, sweetened potato, radish and carrots. 

Prices here are just slightly higher than average. eg pork bone soup is around $8 instead of $5-6. 

Service here is really really slow. I've been here four times and every single time, it seems like only one person is running the floor. Do not come here if you are in a rush. You'll become super irate.

The lounge seemed pretty cool too, the bartenders were hustling about pouring beer and joking with guests sitting at the bar.

The restaurant is nicely separated from the bar and completely smoke free.  There are TV's in the area so you can watch your sports game during your lunch or dinner.

They have a large menu ranging from simple appetizers to full course Surf and Turf meals.  The Stromboli is obviously my favorite.

4,Mesa Grill,"Went for brunch/lunch on a Saturday at 2:30 pm.

Black Widow Mojito - WOW, great cocktail.  I can't wait to make it on my own... but I don't think it will ever turn out that good.

Grilled salmon - great presentation and flavor with sauces on plate... I think it was a really good poblano sauce.  Excellent flavor and loved the tomatillo salsa on top of the fish.  Note to self (or whoever wants to listen): order fish well done.  I ordered mine medium this time and it was a little too underdone in the middle for my tastes.

Sophie's Chopped Salad - eh, I could take it or leave it.  Big chunks of cheese in the salad and the dressing was good but not OMG good.

Pork tenderloin sandwich - OMG good.  Spicy sauce with expertly seasoned and tender pork, great bread.

Roasted beet and grapefruit salad - EXCELLENT.  

Service was great for us, but that is such a subjective thing because someone two tables over from us was hard-core bitching.  They had ordered appetizers, ate the appetizers, then put their order for lunch in and were whining because they saw that we had gotten our salads before their lunch order came out.  Wah, cry about it.  The manager came over and handled that little situation, but we were not disappointed with the service whatsoever.  Our server's name was Miguel, and he was really a very good server.  He made some great recommendations, which I always appreciate, and was, in general, pretty darn smooth.

They told me that they didn't have any ice so they would use cold water and cold milk. The latté was super watery, barely any milk and made my stomach hurt for two days.

It has lost its shine a little (in my eyes) in part to do with the other excellent options now nearby - which is not Manna House's fault - but also I am not sure that the patisserie is what it once was.  What remains excellent is the bread, take away rolls and salads.  I would wish the coffee was better - the Edinburgh competition has left it behind - and the lack of toilet facilities makes it less desirable as a place to sit in.

3,Shanghai Club,"Kind of a funny experience here:  After shopping at the nearby outlet mall, my husband and I decided to look for a Chinese restaurant for lunch.  We found the Shanghai Club at random, but almost didn't go in because from the outside it looks more like a strip club than a proper restaurant.  Imagine our surprise when we opened the mirrored glass front doors just to peak inside, only to find a restaurant filled to more than 50% capacity at lunchtime on a Tuesday. We both ordered from the lunch specials, ranging from $6.50 to $7.50.  I had the Mongolian beef and he had the orange chicken. The cuisine here is standardized Chinese-American food to the max, but both our meals were well prepared, tasty, and of good portion size. The orange chicken was made with all white meat, and fried in relatively fresh oil.  Even my side of banal hot/sour soup was good. My Mongolian beef was slightly overloaded with onions, but included a generous helping of tender stir-fried beef.  I would easily have given this place a 4-star rating had the food been a little more interesting and creative.  The dining room and bathroom were both very clean and orderly, and the place had a nice feel about it.

I ordered the Ohio wagyu and found that the broth became very rich and delicious after cooking about 1/4 of my meat.

First off the staff is still great. That factor hasn't changed. The noodles are still very good.  However, it can only go so far.

The amount of meat in their small beef noodle feels much less than before.  I was trying to dig around after eating the noodles to see if there was any meat left because I didn't think I ate that much.  Unfortunately, no avail.

The soup base itself seems to have changed their recipe.  Its either excessively peppered and/or they added MSG to the soup base which is the main factor why the rating today is so low.  My tongue felt really tingly while I was just eating the noodles that I barely drank the soup.

So much so that once I had finished eating I noticed that the soup level barely dropped.  I couldn't bear to drink the soup and I also noticed my companion didn't drink her soup either.

Wanted some classic fajitas, atmosphere is ok. The restaurant has it's usual south western flair, nothing special.

Had queso w/ mexi beef, this dish was ok, I wouldn't order it again. Served luke warm & forgot beef, sent it back, returned w/ $1.29 worth of mexi beef.
Fajitas were ok, nothing special.

4,Honey Salt,"Finally had a chance to try the trendiest place in town to eat at. I do live on the south side so it was journey traveling all the way here just to grab a bite for lunch. I've passed Rampart Commons numerous times, but never actually shopped at any of the stores. I immediately notice that more than half the cars are luxury cars with range rovers appearing the most, welcome to Summerlin I guess? 

Anyway so Honey Salt is tucked in the corner, a larger sign would probably help them to be more noticeable not that they don't already have good marketing tactics. Apon walking inside from what I remember the walls are mainly composed of bricks. The restaurant is definitely trying to give off that farm vibe, but definitely modern and classy at the same time. A chandelier in a farm though? Haha, I guess that was an accent piece.  I already knew I was going to order the chicken sandwich because of what Misti and Anthony had said in their reviews. Chick Fil A on crack ay? Prior to our food arriving we received our bread and these crispy things almost like pita chips but much thinner. The bread was very similar or even identical to what Filipinos call ""pan de sal,"" but this was a wheat version. Nothing special but the cripy things were rather good and fun to dip with into the white bean dip puree according to my friend? Our food came out pretty quick maybe 15 minutes or so? My friend raved about how good the kale salad was the last time she was here to the point she even dreamt about it. Thankfully the chicken sandwich came with a salad that had kale in it and I was looking forward to it since I've never had kale before. The chicken sandwich was rather stuffed, but that's what I expect when paying $13. The breading on the chicken was pretty good, the honey mustard was probably my favorite part. Usually there isn't enough sauce on sandwiches, but this was the prefect amount. Nice slaw inside the sandwich as well. Overall it was good, but I don't know if it's something to do back flips over if you know what I mean? The side salad was mainly composed of edamame, a little bit of kale, a lot of these seeds (I don't know what kind it was), but which was good. Maybe some type of vinaigrette would have been nice? My friend ordered the meatballs and offered me a bite and that was okay too. Our server Julie was pretty good except I felt like at one point we kind of lost her. The service was definitely better than what I expected based on the early reviews of when they first started. Lastly we ordered the chocolate cake for dessert! OMG soo good probably one of the best pieces of cake I've ever had. 3 layer cake with banana cake in the middle. I thought that was a really nice so it wouldn't be too overwhelming with the chocolate. The frosting outside the cake was light fluffy and not too overly sweet.  I think if I came here again I might just order dessert since the other options seem delicious.",2012-12-13,Las Vegas,-115.292996,36.160577,"['Restaurants', 'American (New)', 'Cafes']"

It is very fatty but it is so good. We tried the curry goat and chichen both seem a little  runny ,there was not much has potatoes or chicken peas..I love their cabbage and red beans and rice.

I would have told them to cancel it, but the mgr. had me pay for it first after telling me it would be just another minute and as stated, another 25 mins. later it was done.

I ordered a large 5 topping pizza and found every topping was scattered incorrect and the bacon was burnt to a crisp and I picked out some fat pieces of bacon as well. Not good.

Later I just felt sick to my stomach and ran into the restroom. 

Could it just been me, or was it eating one disgusting pizza which left a bad taste in my mouth? I didn't even finish it, I threw it in the garbage.

This curry starts at a 4 spice, but I was able to request a 10, as I most usually do when going out for Thai or other similar cuisine.  It was definitely spicy!

I've never had the Korean dish w squash and cheese and I thought it was an interesting mix of food. The seafood pancake was also very delicious especially if you add the soya sauce it comes with. Also had a taste of their fried chicken, seemed a lil plain to me, must eat with sauce.!

2,Stonegrill,"First, the positives. The continental breakfast buffet is phenomenal. Fresh fruit was exceptional, a wonderful selection of dried fruits and toppings, a cooler with fresh milk (dairy and soy) and a variety of yogurts (light, regular, greek), gluten-free baked goods were a bit stale but I appreciated having those options. Fresh juices such as watermelon mint were a treat. The achiote tofu bowl was exceptional. It was a hearty vegetarian meal with roasted caulifower, braised tofu, quinoa, kale and more. It had great flavor and the portion size was generous.

Now for the negatives. The service was abysmal. I have eaten here with my family 5 times this week already since we are staying at the JW Marriott Desert Ridge. We have come in the morning, afternoon and evening and the service has been poor every.single.time. The hostesses look annoyed and are quite apathetic. In the morning, my children ordered a kids meal that took 40 minutes to receive. It does NOT take 40 mins to make french toast sticks. The server never returned to our table once. I had to get up and roam the restaurant to find him. When I asked about the meals, he brought them and....wait for it...they were cold. It took another 20+ minutes to track him down and get the check. Each time I found him chatting with other employees. We ate on the outside patio at 3pm. It was not busy at that time with only one other family in sight. I asked for a highchair for my baby and it took 20+ minutes to get a highchair. I had to ask 3 separate people to get a highchair. Drinks weren't refilled (on a 110 degree day) and the server had the audacity to add the gratuity on himself.

I have had better service at Denny's and am so disappointed that this restaurant is inside a JW Marriott. It certainly doesn't do the resort any favors. It has a lot of potential, but the staff needs to be overhauled.",2016-08-07,Phoenix,-111.965706315,33.6835919733,"['American (Traditional)', 'Restaurants', 'Bars', 'Nightlife', 'Hotel bar', 'Mexican', 'African']"

I've been wanting to eat at Ceres for a while and finally decided to make a reservation in person while I was at the property. That was painful as Ceres is open for breakfast then becomes Carmel Room for happy hour and dinner. The employees at the host stand didn't seem interested in taking my reservation but I did get a phone call confirmation after leaving my info.

We were lucky they had jazz brunch on this Sunday and got a table overlooking one of the property's waterfalls.  Here's my issue with this brunch- it's a glorified continental breakfast. I knew this going in so it's a statement more than a complaint. So, most pics posted here represent a former version of brunch when it looked lavish, was more costly and probably included alcohol. I didn't post food pics cause it was too boring. You can also skip the brunch buffet and order from the breakfast menu. 

We had pretty decent omelets, too hard waffles (no toppings! oh the horror), nice fruit selection, very good fresh juice, Greek yogurt, good coffee in too small cups, good pastries. Plenty of Breakfast items but not so much the lunch portion. No salad or soup. No Benedict (a brunch staple for cryin' out loud). The stations were: made to order omelets/waffles; eggs, potatoes, bacon, sausage; fruit, cheese, cold cuts; cereal/pastries. Our server was great and made sure our beverages were filled. They need to jazz up (pun intended) this brunch.

4,Spigolo Ristorante,"The issue with smaller restaurants whose locations do not lend themselves to heavy foot traffic is that it's hard for anyone other than regulars to find out about them. I found it hard to believe that only 3 people have reviewed Spigolo in over 4+ years of existence. That said, upon arriving, I could see how their small sign and the aforementioned hidden location could be something that's affecting them.

This all to say that if you enjoy a treasure hunt, then Spigolo is the treasure chest that awaits you about 40 paces off of Hwy 7 in Woodbridge - it's an absolute delight!

Savour York Region was the draw, as Spigolo had easily one of the best value for money offerings available. $25 for a 3-course prix fixe menu which went far and about anything I've ever seen before. Most restaurants cheap out and cheap out HARD for restaurant weeks, providing meager portion sizes and limited options for appetizer, mains, and desserts. Spigolo rolls out the red carpet offering top shelf choices like Gorgonzola Gnocchi, Veal Steaks, and the absolutely incredible grilled tuna steak - which absolutely floored members of our group last night, and does not skimp on portion size.

They truly get that a restaurant week is the best way to draw customers IN and impress the pants off of them to earn their patronage from then off. My pants are still off as dinner last night blew me away.

To start they offered roasted hot peppers and garlicky black olives with focaccia style pizzas. For my appetizer course, I had a regional Italian specialty that I haven't had in almost 20 years - lumache (or snails). Done in a white wine sauce it was mouth watering, different than I remembered but cooked to a beautiful texture and flavour (I licked my plate when no one was looking).

For my main course, I went with the gorgonzola gnocchi. The sauce was so thick and so creamy it coated my mouth. I asked for a little hot pepper oil and it was stellar and worked so well to cut the creamy cheesy sauce - and burned so good! I'm usually a red sauce gnocchi guy but this was so amazing I couldn't stop myself and ate nearly every last bite.

To conclude, there were 3 dessert options, being in an Italian restaurant it went without saying that I had the Tiramisu option which came served in a stemless martini glass adorned with cookie/chocolate cigar.

Service was excellent as one server managed to deal with our table of 8, and 4 other large tables with grace and poise.

If you're looking for a pleasant dinner surprise in an intimate environment, look no further than Spigolo, you won't be disappointed.

3,Gordon Ramsay BurGR,"So normally I would not be so picky with a review, however I am obsessed with burgers - eating the best anywhere has to offer and also making them at home. It takes a lot to impress me. When I eat a gourmet burger  I have high expectations.

We tried the truffle fries, blue cheese burger and the jalapeno burger we split the burgers in half so we could share( I don't recall the exact names but these were the main toppings). The blue cheese burger was very nice, lots of blue cheese but I though the bun was disappointing. At $15  a burger I expect a much higher quality type of bread. Overall a delicious burger. The Jalapeno one, I was expecting a little spice - not at all spicy, not even an after kick, I didn't even finish it as it was just totally lacking in flavor.

Lastly we ordered the burgers medium well and they came out pink in the middle  and the service was not particularly fast - tons of servers , not that many diners but the kitchen was slow when we went. Everyone was really nice though and they were open late which we appreciated.

The TRUFFLE FRIES - AMAZEBALLS. 

So overall, yes yummy food, but for someone who really considers themselves  a foodie with a burger obsession I felt that while food was good it was overall nothing to really brag about. Go check it out for yourself and order the truffle fries. I personally feel that Umami Burger is much better than this place.",2014-08-13,Las Vegas,-115.172169,36.110724,"['Restaurants', 'Burgers']"

Patties always bring me back to high school days, since I would get a beef patty literally (note the correct use of ""literally"") everyday between first and second period. This bit of nostalgia meant that the noticeably fresher patties at Patties Express was a huge delight!

BF and I got our little snack of 2 patties and a pop for $5. Great deal for a good lil snack! I picked the mild beef patty, for pure Nostalgia, and BF got the chicken. The chicken was a bit spicy, kinda curry-like. Both were great, and nice and hot to eat right away.

Side Story: As we eat outside on the bench, we are pestered by little birds for crumbs. My BF bestows some ""age-old"" wisdom to me: birds to do not sh*t on the people who feed them. And the age-old Murphy's Law kicked in 1 minute later, when a shot of birdsh*t narrowly misses my BF, and is the exact colour of the patties we just ate.

This is one of the few restaurants on the strip that actually has real windows to the outside world (no fake ceiling here) which was refreshing. A little loud in the dining room - but then is Vegas known for being quiet? 
We had:
Salumi plate- salumi was terrific, cheeses better than average, olives OK
Eggplant parm- on app menu & can be shared even though waitress said it was too small for sharing. Easily enough for 6 to share
Scallopps- not very Italian, was it bacon? too over cooked but polenta & scallopps were perfect
The lasagne was HUGE & very good.
Kids chix parm was a large sized portion and excellent. 
Chix marsala came with 3 pieces of chicken!
Ceasar Salad was tastey but way over dressed. Very soggy. Ask for less dressing.

5,Sushi Mon,"I prefer sashimi over special rolls. A la carte over all you can eat. And eating sushi in non-landlocked states. But I absolutely love Sushi Mon--I love it so much that I forgot about my distinct preferences and had both AYCE lunch ($24) and dinner ($27) here in the same week.

There are dozens of items on the menu, everything made to order, including nigiri, special rolls, side dishes and rice bowls. I assumed the 45-minute limit for lunch and one-hour limit for dinner would be insufficient, but the human body is superhuman under pressure and  service is so fast it redefines fast food. 

The baked green mussels are out of this world. I must have had five on my first visit. I also can't get enough of the special rolls like the spider and volcano. The best part is you can order half rolls, so you can try more rolls. As if the menu selection wasn't enough, there's ice cream to complete your meal.

4,Auberge Willow,"Remember Twin Peaks?  If David Lynch owned a shorefront bar in Quebec this would be the one.

Willow Inn claims to be more than 100 years old, though only the fireplace dates from before the mid-1960s.  Decor is pretty ""rural Canada bar"" style, except for the gorgeous view of the Ottawa river and the Oka ferry going back and forth (back and forth, etc.).  They also have a lawn/terrace where you can have drinks but no food.

Hudson is a charming town about halfway between Ottawa and Montreal.   Even if you've never been there you've seen it before times.  It is often the location for tv shows and movies that purport to be set in small town New England.  

The customers at the Willow are just, well, quirky.  Like a lot of failed reality show performers got together in one place to drink and dine.  (Think of Dog the Bounty Hunter, his lovely wife Beth, any Jersey Shore cast member, and the touring cast of Bon Cop, Bad Cop.)   Downtown Hudson tends to be a lot more buttoned-down.  Out here on the fringes, no so much.

Some of the appeal might be the weekend wine deal? (Liquor store cost plus $5 per bottle).

So enough snobbery.  The food was really good.  The french fries were excellent (and this is perhaps the toughest pommes frites crowd in the world outside of Belgium). I had a carrot cheddar soup that sounds weird but was weird in a delicious way... and the burger was really, really excellent -- thick, juicy and a perfect 10.",2011-05-07,Hudson,-74.1093025,45.448491600000004,"['Bed & Breakfast', 'Hotels', 'Event Planning & Services', 'Venues & Event Spaces', 'Restaurants', 'Hotels & Travel']"

Service was excellent. Our waiter was very friendly and courteous.

Drinks:
White wine pairing (Forgot the name.. haha)

Appetizers:
S'MORES FOIE GRAS
(graham cracker crumble, chocolate sauce and toasted marshmallow cream)
So far I still think Canoe makes one of the best foie gras dishes in Toronto. I've tried other ways of making the foie gras dishes at Canoe before and it never disappoints! Always very delicious.

Mains:
WAGYU TRI-TIP
(smoked tongue, king oyster mushrooms, purple potato + bacon chive jus)
Highly recommending this! So glad they didn't take this off the menu - out of all the dishes I've tried so far, the wagyu beef is the most tender and delicious one :)

ONTARIO LAMB DUO 
(roasted loin + olive anchovy rubbed lamb ham, rosemary artichokes, fresh shelled beans)
Such a cute display. The lamb was very tender (each meat was a different part of the lamb).
The veggies paired with it were also delish!

GRASS RUBBED BISON RIB EYE
(green tomato, horseradish greens, pickled cauliflower, tonka bean + k2 Milling grain pakoras)
The meats were amazing - but I didn't really like the pickled cauliflower. A little too sour for my taste. Other than that, everything about this dish was wonderful.

Dessert:
CLASSIC CANOE BUTTER TART
(smoked vanilla cream, flax seed nougatine, rye + ginger ice cream)
We were actually trying to order the dessert that we got last time but chose the wrong one haha. BUT! It was a good ""mistake"" because this was DELICIOUS!! So yummy!!

5,E-Jo Korean Restaurant,"I came here with my parents, since Baja Fresh was closed. They asked me how about this place... I was hesitate at first, since I didn't hear much great things, but when my mother told me all my relatives from Korea LOVED this place when they visited Vegas for my cousin's wedding... that changed everything. My mother goes.. have you even tried their food??!! I said Nooo, but heard it wasn't good. Then she goes.. how You know that if you never tried this place yet??!?!! Good point...

That being said... we went in and the owner recognized my Father. My father goes.. you remember me?? The owner goes... yes of course!!! The story behind this was.. when my relatives from Korea were in town.. they literally came here every single day for two weeks. They Loved their soups and thought it was better than Tofu Hut. The owner even gave my uncle a free bottle of soju when he ate there.. If you don't know about my uncle.. he drinks soju... in the morning, afternoon, evening, and even late night!! It's a Korean tradition back home I swear!!!

We all ordered their Oxknee Soup.. which is #5 on the top list of food picture you see on the right side when you walk in or in the menu book .. under Soup.. it's #3 called Beef Knee Bone Soup. If you like tendons, the chewy muscles... this will be your favorite soup to have. My parents say this soup is the best from all the others. The broth is milky, beige from all the slow cooking from the bones of the meats. It's so soothing and tasty. I loved it!!! I added tons of sliced green onion and a tablespoon of salt, but you can determine how much you want. The tendons were soft, jelly-like chewy texture... only a few were somewhat firm in chewing. If the pieces are too big to put in your mouth, there's a scissor to cut it in pieces.. which is also used for the two types of kimchi they give you. One is napa cabbage and the other is daikon radish... it comes in two thick dark jars and an endless amount of kimchi to your hearts desire!!! There's a separate dish, where you place the kimchi's to cut into pieces and add to the soup or eat as a condiment. They first bring out six complimentary pieces of deep fried zucchini.. then the kimchi. We were also given a jalapeno, daikon, and diced onion marinated in soy sauce to eat on the side with the soup.

The daikon radish kimchi was perfectly fermented that it had a great crunch and crisp, fresh taste to it. My mother commented on how good it was. They also give you a sauce to dip the tendons in, which consist of soy sauce and hot mustard.. you mix it together and dip the tendon or should I say coat the tendon in and eat it with the bowl of rice... sip the broth of the soup after and it all goes down so well. Delicious, soothing, and perfect for a cold winter night or day!

They provide barley tea and at the end.. you get a free cup of cold, refreshing sweet rice drink for dessert. It also helps with digestion my mother pointed out. Great way to wash everything down and even in Winter, it was so invigorating to drink. Loveloveloved it!!! 

This place is right across the street, adjacent to Cafe Moda and in the same complex of 168 Market. It has brown brick walls and a red sign on top of the restaurant. The sign is written in Korean, so don't bother looking for E-Jo at all. They have about eight tables inside and a tv that has some korean drama playing. I didn't think much of this place from the reviews I read, but this place ended up to be such a delightful surprise. They are known for their soups and tasty broth. Service was great and the soup was therapeutic. It stayed hot for a long while, since the pot kept the heat in the soup and even after.. the broth stayed perfectly warm to just sip through. My father told me when you eat this soup, you won't get hungry for a long time. It was very filling, but in a good way. It just relaxes you... I guess you really can't judge a place by a few bad reviews. You need to come here and try it yourself or at least with someone that knows what's good here.

We always start with the Onion Strings. They are crispy, slightly greasy and really flavorful. They come with a rèmoulade sauce. Once you start eating these, it's difficult to stop. 

We each got the 2 meat lunch special. I got the BBQ chicken, and the ribs. It was 1/4 chicken with a dry rub, and two ribs. I was served the white meat chicken, while my mother-in-law was given dark meat. There was quite a bit of meat on both the chicken and the ribs. We each got a corn muffin along with the meat, and a choice of a side. I got the potato salad, which had a bit of what I am guessing was pickle relish. I am not a fan of relish, but it was just a touch and was pretty tasty. 

My MIL asked for extra butter, and was given a small cup of whipped butter. What comes with the muffins are small plastic containers of butter, so this was a nice touch. I like that there is roll of paper towels at the table...no need to ask for extra napkins...and many different BBQ sauces to choose from. If you have never been to Famous Dave's, they will describe each of the sauces for you. 
Always good service, and consistently good food.",2015-06-07,Henderson,-115.04358,36.064231,"['Barbeque', 'Restaurants']"
4,Cafe Le Theatre,"Nach einem Einkaufsbummel sind wir hier eingekehrt. Sind zu einer guten Zeit gekommen und konnten im Nichtraucherbereich zwischen 3 Tischen wählen. Kurz darauf waren alle Tische besetzt und immernoch irrten suchende Menschen umher, um einen Platz zu ergattern. 
Schön fand ich, dass es einen abgetrennten (mit geschlossenen Türen) Raucherbereich gab. So wurden wir zu keiner Zeit gestört. 
Die Bedienung war nett, höflich und hat auch alles schnell serviert, obwohl meiner Meinung nach noch eine Bedienung gut getan hätte. 
Wir hatten Salat bestellt, konnten aber auch von unserem Platz sehen, was die anderen Gäste serviert bekamen. Alles sah frisch und ansprechend aus. 
Neben den Standardgerichten gibt es auch eine Sonderkarte mit wechselnden Speisen. 
Die Kuchenauswahl war mit einem Käsekuchen sehr dürftig, aber abends um 19 Uhr auch vertretbar. 
Mir persönlich hat das Ambiente sehr gut gefallen. Hat schon ein Theater-Feeling. Die ""auf alt gemachten"" Stühle fand ich auch sehr schön. 
Es gibt auch einen Biergarten, der überdacht ist. 
Wir werden auch hier sicher nicht das letzte mal gewesen sein.

I had the eggs with crepes and it was almost like having two breakfasts- a regular breakfast with eggs, toast and home fries and then having dessert breakfast.  The selection was so varied that I had trouble choosing.  There were several of us and we also ordered eggs benedict and the breakfast poutine.  The poutine was extremely rich.  Everything was delicious!  The staff was friendly and, as it was Halloween, everyone had a costume, even early in the morning.

The food was great but at times awkward to eat (spoonfuls of ceviche and fall-apart fish tacos). Our table was rather small and was a bit too close to the hostess' podium but was by the window, hence it made up for location through its people watching abilities. The darker part of the restaurant closer to the bar looked more alluring. Nevertheless, I am a fan due to the high quality of food (fresh fish) and unique bathrooms (complete with pictures of toddlers). The space is beautiful. There is half-price wine & sake on Tuesdays.

2,Taqueria Guadalajara,"In the famous words of Chuck D and Flavor Flave ""don't believe the hype.""

For years our friends of been raving about this place.  We have heard people call this the ""best Mexican restaurant in Madison"" and other people call it the ""absolute best Mexican food period.""   So after a couple years of wanting to try this place...we finally did.

I cannot complain about the aesthetics...it is a cute little place without all the traditional bright colors....but thats where the good ends.

FIRST OFF:   How can you have a Mexican Restaurant that does not serve Margaritas?    Really?   When I want to devour a burritos I want some Tequila and Lime to go with it.   Even if it is the pre-made junk.

SECOND:  The food was bland.....about as bland as bland can be.   My wife ordered a Chicken Quesadilla as she always does at Mexican restaurant and it literally had ZERO taste.    Heck she had to use all of the salsa form the chips to even remotely get a flavor to it.   Oh...and speaking of chips....they are complete straight out of the bag store bought terrible chips.  Even Laredo's has better chips....well...actually they have better food all together and that is saying a lot!

THRID:  Lets talk my burrito.   I decided to go a different route than my normal fajitas or taco salad and got myself a steak burrito.   OMG....this this was.....TERRIBLE!   The steak was as hard as a rock.  The burrito itself was even more bland than my wife's quesadilla and literally had NO TASTE AT ALL.   Worst part is she stole all the salsa and it took the rest of the meal to get more.

So...when heading up Park street and wanting Mexican food this place is a joke.   Traditional....sure but tasteless traditional and just...I would rather eat at Taco Bell.",2015-09-02,Madison,-89.3974165,43.055569,"['Mexican', 'Restaurants']"

1,Oregano's Pizza Bistro,"This location was my worst Oregano's experience ever. I have been to several other valley locations over the years and have never been disappointed by the food or level of service provided. Being that this location is the newest, and also the consistency between other locations, I had high expectations for my experience here. 
First of all, the waitress that served our table did not seem well suited for her position. She seemed lost and overwhelmed the entire dinner, did not check in frequently enough to fill our drinks, and generally did not seem to understand the responsibilities of a waitress. 
As for the food, I was extremely disappointed. I love the pesto pizza and the Italian wedding soup and both were a major let down here. The pizza had hardly any pesto, which completely lacked flavor, and was smothered in way too much cheese. The soup was also greatly lacking in flavor as well as the meatballs. Overall, the food was tasteless and inconsistent with other oregano's locations. On top of this we had to wait over an hour to get our food with no explanation as we sat and waited. 
I will not be returning to this location nor will I recommend it to anyone.",2015-07-10,Goodyear,-112.38789820000001,33.4649623296,"['Pizza', 'Restaurants', 'Italian', 'Sandwiches']"

1,China Poblano,"Walking up to this restaurant, I thought it was a Mexican and Chinese infused ingredients/food/flavor restaurant which would have been original and creative. In actuality, you can order dim sum and a taco at the same time here. 

The Mexican food was flavorful. The guac was perfect balance of cilantro and onion and avocado. The homemade salsa had some kick and their Mexican meat was tender. 

On the other hand, the sui mai I ordered was a big disappointment. It was almost to the point of raw and tiny compared to typical dim sum restaurants. I didn't like the fact that I just had guac and then took a bit of dim sum after. 

The biggest reason I'm giving this place 1 star and never coming back is the seating arrangement. The tables are about a foot away from each other and when I went, the place was near empty and the hostess still sat a group of men at the table right beside us. We were so close to them that the guy beside me flicked me with his menu turning it over on accident twice. There were empty tables behind me and behind my friend. The only excuse we got was that they like to close half the restaurant.",2014-05-07,Las Vegas,-115.17481374,36.1098709067,"['Asian Fusion', 'Mexican', 'Restaurants', 'Chinese']"
4,The Buffet,"Saturday lunch: $32

Surprisingly it wasn't packed at all! If you were @ the Bellagio, there's a line almost all the time. We chose to go around 3 just before dinner starts because it's $7 cheaper. It's $39 for dinner btw.Their selections are pretty much the same like the Bellagio (Italian, Pizza, Salads, Shellfish, Desserts, Crepes, Prime Rib, etc etc). Unfortunately, I didn't get to try everything! There was so much to try and we got full after an hr.

We started off with salads and I love it. I don't know what kind of dressing they use but it was good. Yes, I paid $32 for some delicious salads!! Got a full plate of king crab legs because that's pretty much all you go to the buffet for? The line is always long for this so make sure to grab something on your plate and eat while waiting. I think it tastes better hot than cold so just ask them to grill it up for you. I didn't try their salmon & chicken but I heard it's not bad! 

Since I tried Wynn Buffet from many years ago, I really didn't pay attention about the sushi at that time. Unfortunately, they only have 3 rolls for the sushi selection. Booo-hoo! This is why I preferred the Bellagio better because they do have sushi even though their rice sucks! I just eat it without the rice = sashimi! 

Their desserts selection is soo cute! Everything is tiny so you get to try a lot of stuffs. I don't remember if Bellagio is the same or not. I tried a whole bunch and one of them was my favorite.

My last night in Las Vegas.  Tia and Jesse gave me a gift certificate to the Mad Greek Cafe.  Jesse told me that he couldn't really eat anything at this restaurant and he received the gift certificate as a thank you gift for placing an ad for his garage door installation business.

I'd never been to such a HUGE Greek restaurant ever!  There were white Greek lawn ornaments on the roof of their restaurant, a dance floor inside, and a huge chandelier hanging from the ceiling.

I ordered the stuffed grape leaves (my favorite) and their small Greek salad.  The grape leaves didn't come with any dipping sauce, but they were still good.

There was a crazy hamburger on the menu that consisted of a heaping of pastrami on top of the burger patty!  I don't usually order burgers at restaurants, so I just read about it.",2011-09-06,Las Vegas,-115.27846399999999,36.1428,"['Greek', 'Mediterranean', 'Restaurants']"

But since my cousin told me that Wicked Spoon was 10x's better, my boyfriend and I decided to give it a try. We went there dinner time on a Tuesday night, and the place was half filled. We are seated immediately and head over to the food to begin Gorge Fest 2011. I was excited at first because of the presentation. A lot of the food came in cute little pots, but most of it was lacking in taste. I tried the bone marrow, which is supposed to be their specialty, I have to say there was more grease than marrow. The shrimp was alright, plump but that's all I can say about it. The crab legs were ok, but I was a bit disappointed since the Aria offers not just snow crab legs, but also King crab. Again, the Wicked Spoon was only visually pleasing, because the dessert bar kinda made me feel like a kid in a candy store with all their selections. I must have had 8 different desserts on my plate, and none are really worth mentioning.

I ordered the combo that included a double chilicheese burger, fries and drink. Burgers are cooked to order and the food was delivered to my table in a reasonable time. My impressions:
- Burger was very good but somewhat sloppy, as expected. Chili was good but not exceptional. Homemade cole slaw is available if you want a Carolina-style chiliburger
- Fries were excellent, just as good as Five Guys and almost as many on the plate
- Decent selection of soft drinks and fresh brewed iced tea
- The table next to me had ordered the onion rings and they commented that they were the best they had ever had.

Suggestions:
- Don't place trash cans next to dining tables
- A roll of rough paper towels on each table is not an improvement over decent napkins

Conclusion: Yes, I would definitely eat here again and also try the onion rings.",2014-07-24,Charlotte,-80.88416525529999,35.1799921515,"['Restaurants', 'Burgers']"
2,Angelina's Pizzeria,Ordered a medium pizza and 12 piece wings last night. Wait time was normal not too bad. I was really disappointed in the quality of the pizza. It looked and tasted like it hadn't been cooked long enough the dough was slightly raw and every time I picked up a slice all of the toppings fell off which forced me to eat it with a fork for the most part. I wouldn't mind a longer wait time if they would have just cooked the damn pizza properly. The wings on the other hand were pretty good. It was definitely overpriced for what I got.

But.. when it arrived. What I saw, was not so Parisian, we got 1 whole see-through slice of ham. woopdidoo. 

The cheese wasn't very awesome either, especially when you can see I.J Mellis next door. They should start getting a bit of their cheese from there! I felt like I was eating a new style of cheese wiz. That thing had weird texture.

Barista was very friendly and made me a nice cortado. The taste of the coffee was above average, a tad more bitter than I usually like it, but the readily available raw sugar on the bar made a vast improvement. I'd say it's on par with Lux and a cut above Cartel.

Falafel pita is awesome but the hummus and tabbouleh pita is outrageous.  They give you big portions of hummus and tabbouleh with a pita on the side, it's the one leftover I consistently eat.  My husband raved about the Gambas Con Ajo.

1,Sports Deli,"Wait in line. Keep waiting. Wait some more. If they do acknowledge your existence, it will be with surliness.

Thus is the summary of the last three consecutive experiences with this place. Oh, and after all that waiting and rudeness, I still ended up elsewhere. First two times because NO ONE ever took my order - nor even made eye contact, even though they were three feet away. Last week, the entire line of people gave up after waiting for 15 minutes and went to Subway for lunch. The only person to get eye contact from an employee also got tools they couldn't get what they ordered. Something about a special code needed to make the grills hot? Meanwhile, other folks got their burgers. WTF? These people hate their jobs.

Three chances. This one was shame on me for trying again. Better service at McDonald's. And I bloody hate McDonald's.

I know that happens in almost any restaurant, but the kitchen shouldn't make it obvious

4,Buddha Belly Deli,"I can't believe that I just made into this place and they are closing. What a gem!

The girl that took our orders and brought them to the table was very friendly. She was taking and delivering orders for everyone and keeping a friendly attitude while doing so.

We ordered the Chicken Katsu Club and Szechuan Shrimp Po-Boy. One with the slaw and the other with the homemade chips. The Chicken Katsu Club was my favorite. The chicken had a really nice crispy breading and there was plenty of chicken on the club. The sauce on the club was yummy too. The Szechuan Shrimp Po-Boy flavor caught me off guard at first because it was very unique, but I ended up enjoying the sandwich. The shrimp on this also had a nice, light breading. The chips were great and the seasoning was nice. The slaw was pretty good.

They arrived on cute wooden boards, as well as an infused oil of some sort that I found myself dipping my crust into. The pizza was flavorful and delicious (it also made for yummy leftovers the next morning haha!).

4,Hawker Bar,"Hawker Bar pays homage to Singapore style street 'hawker' food with it's own rustic and Western twist to it.  A team of super friends including the owners of one of my very favourite establishments, Poutini's, are behind this intimate resto located on the trendy Ossington strip and have opened my eyes and taste buds to the versatile sweet, sour and spicy flavours of Singapore cuisine.The appetizers we sampled are must haves at Hawker.The Chilli Salt tofu were little deep fried tofu cubes that were lightly dusted with chilli salt and refreshing lime were a good bite size in your mouth with a nice pop of flavour and crunch.  
Additionally the Singapore chicken wings are good enough for just a savoury snack or to wet your pallet for your meal.   They were salty but sweet and a hint of spice, wet enough but dry and not too too messy - my kind of wings.  We fought over the last one in our group of four. 

For mains, we sample a number of dishes on the menus which were made out of cardboard - a nice touch to the modesty of street culture. 
The first dish that came out was their version of the Hainanese Chicken rice.  I grew up on poached chicken so I was in love.  The only complaint is I adore dark meat and it was only served with white meat.  The chicken was served with 3 different sauces (chilli, soy and ginger) and the trick to this dish is to experiment and mix the sauces with the chicken to create different combinations of flavour.  My recommendation is to pair the chicken with ginger and a hint of the chilli!
We also sampled the 'singapore style' noodles - the flavours were unlike any Asian noodle dish that I have had, it was complex and heavy but light all the while being a delicious addition to our meal.  
We had to try Hawker's version of the popular Singapore dish - the Laksa Lemak which is a thick and rich coconut curry soup with yellow rice noodles, fresh snow peas, egg plant, red pepper and tofu puffs all mixed into it.  Our portion size was definitely large enough to share with the four of us and then some.  It was creamy and tart with good texture from the fresh ingredients and a surprise runny egg which was a nice bonus.

Finally we tried their sting ray.  I have never been a huge fan of sting ray but the server convinced me that it would taste as rich and tender as scallops and right he was!  It was really flaky and light however there was too much sting and not enough ray referring to the number of long bones in the sting ray so be very careful when eating.

Our bellies were quite full of Hawker style food but also cocktails as we drank our way through their creative drink menu as well but we were convinced again by our server to attempt dessert which were their banana fritters.  Came to our table bright green, served with red bean ice cream, were simply delectable and a perfect way to end our evening.

What a good introduction to the flavours of Singapore!   This is a great spot for a new type of Asian cuisine and would highly recommend a visit!",2012-11-09,Toronto,-79.4203829,43.6482809,"['Asian Fusion', 'Nightlife', 'Restaurants', 'Bars']"

Ten minutes later, a couple is seated there. I don't know if you can understand my frustration but that made me livid. Our waitress hardly checked on us. Water was always empty.

The wait staff was quick on their feet, and the Margarita I got was full of booze. So no complaints in that department. Nice outdoor seating! Great Bar area!

First we walked around and looked at all the specialty items that were scattered around the store. Being a wine enthusiast, I got to see some interesting wines sitting in their beautiful wine racks. 

For how busy it was in there, it only took us 2 minutes to order, because of their employees to help guide you though. Both of us ordered delicious egg sandwiches on english muffins. Having choices of different topping I went with avocado, sausage, tomato, and cheese. With Jamie doing the similar, but with bacon. (There was a jealously generous amount of it too!) 

While we waited for the sandwiches, we got coffees from their espresso bar, and walked around the shop some more. After grabbing the sandwiches and taking them outside to share a picnic table with some strangers, we devoured our orders and sipped out coffees.

Once you eat here, you're spoiled and no other place can measure up!

I've been eating here at least 1-2 times a month for about 6 years now. It's just fantastic, and the food and service make up for the Styrofoam plates and plastic cutlery. Every time I have a guest in from out of town, THIS is where I take them. My boyfriend always jokes that it's the only place he's ever eaten where he can't help but make yummy-noises with every single bite. I used to live right around the corner, but even though I'm in north Toronto now, we still make the drive frequently to get our Lahore Tikka fix!

Every time we come we get the butter chicken, palak paneer, channa masala, aloo ghobi, and several rice and naan, with sweet lassi. In the summer, I'll get a kulfi which they make in-house and which is just fantastic, and in the winters I'll sometimes indulge in their Kashmir tea that they make at your table for you. I've never once been disappointed in all the times I've been there.

It has a nice community feel, with the big open-concept dining room. I LOVE in summer time when they open up a huge covered patio for diners. Although the staff there is huge - which is great, because you always get great attendant service - they make you feel at home. Several of the servers there always recognize me, and give me a big welcome, asking how I've been, cracking jokes about how recently I've been in, or noticing if something kept me away for awhile. 

Everything is made fresh, and it comes out sizzling. The flavors are deep, and complex, with just the right amount of spice - makes your nose run, but doesn't flay your tongue and palette!

When we ordered it took literally like 45mins to get our food, in the mean time we were not asked if we would like a refill on our drink or if we were okay, and sorry about the wait. 45 mins later we finally got our food, which my husband and I felt bad about because there was another coupke with kids there before us that still didn't have there food yet. Finally after about 10 mins the other couple and there kids got there food remind you they had ordered pancakes, i mean anyone knows pancake do NOT take that long to make. After we got our food and another refill we were asked about ice cream, we never asked for it but I guess it's included in every meal which would of been great if my daughter would have been with us.

Lets start off with the ambiance 6/5...this is one of the nicest restaurants I have ever been to anywhere.  Minimalist decor, super, super spacious, many options including semi private couch seating for couples - all with incredible views of Scottsdale and sorrounding mountains....

Caesar salad 2/5 (it was the only food on the menu I did not care for as it had bacon and other non-traditional ingredients I did not like)

12 oz Filet 5/5 (medium rare plus)

Side order of mushrooms and cauliflour 5/5

Bread 4/5

Drinks 4+/5 (I only tried the original margarita) you can have whatever you like as most bars, but their list is comprised of traditional styled drinks (preparation the way they were originally conceived...)

Chocolate Dessert 5/5, special root beer dessert weak 2/5

Service 5/5

Pricing is fair and comparable to most upscale steak houses. 

Bottom line...if you want the best steakhouse in Phoenix, maybe the camelback inn's BLT steak is still the best for steak (bone-in filet), an Ocean Club at Kierland (if you want more of a people watching, live music & open restaurant feel) But dont discard orange sky if you are looking for incredible views, in a super chic setting, with pretty good food and service.",2014-06-10,Scottsdale,-111.86944146399999,33.540285939,"['Steakhouses', 'Seafood', 'Restaurants', 'American (New)']"
3,Rachel's Kitchen,"Ive heard such great things, so I expected great things. It was good, but not great.

To start, I understand that while people are preparing others foods, when you see two people standing there waiting to order, the least you can say is, I'll be with you shortly, or someone will be with you shortly, or hey, go screw yourself.....something! That kinda put me off, but whatever, I'm hungry, let's eat!

I ordered the grilled veggie salad. I was disappointed it didn't come with more veggies. The ones that were there were delicious! The roasted red peppers were not. I loathe jarred roasted peppers. Take the time and toast them yourself, it's easy and not very time consuming. I will say it was a nice sized bowl of lettuce, I liked that. The dressing was OK, definitely could have used some more, but I wasn't about to go stand there like an idiot again and wait for it.

My friends ordered the grilled chicken sandwich and a wrap. They wrap the wrap in lots and lots of paper. It took her some time to get it off (pervert, I know that you are thinking!). They also ordered 2 smoothies before the meal. One was a peanut butter one and it was tasty but too thick, especially for the straw they provide. The other was a banana kinda smoothie that while I dont dig the banana taste, it was much easier to enjoy.

My company, the absolutely FABULOUS Christina and Arvin, made the meal fantastic. I always have the best time with them and enjoy every minute!

I'd definitely try Rachel's again, I think I'm going for the grilled cheese next time. Sounds good.

4,Baguette Cafe,"We went on a Yelp exploration and came upon this cafe. You know the jittery feeling when you first step into an unfamiliar place and try to figure out how and what to order?

When he was done, we wanted to get everything on the menu because they all sound amazing! Then, he was kind enough to offer us samples of his two daily soups while we were deciding what to get. And then, of course, we wanted to get the Shrimp Bisque too (simply heavenly)!

Since we went for tea, we ended up only getting a chocolate torte, lemon torte, croissant, thai chai, hot chocolate and white mocha. Please, please do get the tortes. The chocolate one was rich but with a fine balance of cocoa and sweetness. The lemon one was a fantastic explosion of citrus loveliness. I also liked the croissant, tasted just like France's very own.

The home fries were diced and deep fried but not a bit greasy. How did they do that? My enthusiasm was such that I had to make myself slow down. ( I'm a lady, right?)
  My husband had the....get this....Peach Cobbler Pancakes. Omg. The panckes were fluffy, with a topping of peaches, dusted with powdered sugar and sprinkled with pie crust crumbles. The side of ham was more like a slab of ham. It was a beautiful sight. He enjoyed every mouthful. 
  They offer so many delightful omelets, pancakes and crepes, I'm looking forward to my next visit. Maybe I'll have the banana custard pancakes with nutella spread and sliced bananas. Or maybe I will have the salmon benedict; eggs benedict with smoked salmon and light caper sauce. MMM mm mm.

We were standing near the counter and trying to decide to use the 2 hours for the price of one or the bogo discounts. The guy at the counter said we could start bowling and they would us the coupon that was less expensive when we were done.

We kept our eyes on the lock and after a while decided we'd use the two hours for the price of one option. The problem is that when we went to pay there was a different guy at the counter. He told us the hourly option was pre-pay only. He made no effort to help us out and was really quite disagreable.

3,Thor Espresso Bar,"Ambiance/Good-Stuff

As the name suggests, this place definitely is a tribute to the Swedish style of home decor and it's quite minimalistic in style. Many reviews describe it as cozy, I describe it as lacking but I suppose that's the whole point. Being 6""3, i found it really hard to sit in many of their chairs while their bar stools were uncomfortably positioned made this an awkward chill-out time for me. Fast and reliable internet, the lack of workspace makes it a hard sell if you want to do any work..

While the rude barista attitude can be forgiven(only one of them), the espresso-based beverages make up for it completely. My first impression of the Mjolnir shot is that it's a fantastic choice if you want something to give you a good kick (hint: mix the condensed milk and espresso quite thoroughly). I finished the experience with a simple cappuccino which actually might be one of the best and tastiest caps i've ever had the pleasure of drinking :)

Barista skills: 10 - A new favorite espresso shot + plus general great tasting coffee
Barista Attitude: 5 - One was a total douche while the other was super nice about the whole experience
Dating Appeal: 5 - Not my place to take someone out to have a long earth-shattering chat but it might be yours?
Overall Ambiance: 6 - If i'm in Toronto and I want an ""out of this world"" espresso experience in my mouth then this is it (and yes, worth the amazing walk on King Street West :)).

Arrived at lunch, and the staff is in ""training"" mode so it took forever for them to take the two orders ahead of me, and the line behind grew very quickly.  If the service was quick, then I would certainly rate it a four.  Had the ""Bueno Burger"" with jack cheese.  I think this is something else I don't like about the place, you need to add .75 for cheese. I'd prefer if they included cheese with each type of burger.

4,Square Cafe,"I am updating my review for Square Cafe, as promised, because in the past few months they have changed their menu a bit, and their coffee has improved substantially.  These two changes make a big difference.  The new menu, while still trying a bit too hard, now has flavorful food.

I don't know whether they changed their coffee blend, or just their process, but it's now been drinkable several times running.  So I give you permission to eat here again.  Congratulations to Square Cafe for solving the coffee issue!

Two things anyone eating here should still be aware of:  First, the portions are too large, which is certainly not going to bother most people - but if you're coming with a group, or with kids, just keep it in mind.  Second, ordering a la carte or off-menu is very, very expensive, so think carefully before you ask for an omelette that's not on the menu.",2010-04-30,Pittsburgh,-79.8932691965,40.4321137573,"['Food', 'Cafes', 'Coffee & Tea', 'Vegetarian', 'Food Trucks', 'Breakfast & Brunch', 'Restaurants']"

4,Joe's Diner,"First trip here in July 2011. Got there, placed order at 11:26am, food delivered at 11:44am. Ordered the Beef on Weck. Delivered with skin-on fries, pickle slices, horseradish, and a tall glass of lemonade. The main dining area was about half full. 
This was one of the best roast beef sandwiches I have ever had, much better than Arby's by far. The fries were also very good. 
There is a large private parking lot on the south side of the building. Easy access off 16th St, better to approach from the south, there are two parking lot entrances on 16th St. Check out their menu and  hours online before you go. www.joesdineraz.com

Total cost, sandwich, drink, tax, tip came to $15.

The place has always appeared clean, staff was fast and friendly, sort of like ""you are family"" friendly. 

The return trip I got the Beef on Weck again and had a muffuletta to go. This is essentially an italian sub with a small amount of olive salad on top of the meat. The original one comes from New Orleans from the Central Grocery.

3,Perk Eatery,"After hearing that the owners of Perk Eatery were from Michigan, I think I got my hopes up that they'd be able to make fluffy omelettes like I get back home... unfortunately, that wasn't the case.  However, I did enjoy my meal at this little locally owned restaurant.  

I met a friend at Perk for a weekday lunch last Wednesday.  I'd been wanting to try it for awhile and wasn't surprised to find it hiding in a strip mall (like so many little gems here in AZ).  The atmosphere was nothing special but we chose to sit outside as it was a beautiful day.  My friend had an omelette and I had a Greek Salad.  The service was not attentive despite the fact that there were few patrons while we were there.  (I have a feeling they get slammed for weekend brunches though).  The food was good; not mindblowing, but decent.  I like the fact that they use fresh, local, and organic ingredients.  One more perk is that I believe they have free wi-fi (but I cannot attest to using it).

Would I return? Sure.  
Am I rushing back? No, but I don't want to deter you from checking it out.  And please let me know if you are more ""perked up"" after dining at Perk than I am!",2012-05-02,Scottsdale,-111.940520983,33.6241531356,"['Breakfast & Brunch', 'Restaurants', 'Diners']"

3,Pittsburgh International Airport,"This airport is like a ghost town.  Here is the whole scoop:

Security:  Awful.  It takes forever.  There are only four lines.  I've stood for well over two hours in the mornings and peak travel times.  This would be fine if it was a busy airport, but there are barely any flights in and out.  Not ok.

Seating:  Comfortable and plenty.

Outlets:  I've never even seen one.

Wifi:  Free

Food options:  Plenty of McDonalds.  I would try the other places, but no where is ever open.  I fly about once a month.  You will be hard pressed to find anything to eat here before 630 or 7 in the morning and after 7 at night.  Shops and most food stores hours are far worse than that.  Getting stuck in this airport is torture with this GIANT problem.

Shopping:  PLENTY.  Lots and lots of stores.  Luggage, socks, sunglasses.... Everything you could ever feel like buying in an airport.

Structure:  This is the good part.  The airport is shaped like an X.  It's super easy to get around.",2013-05-10,Pittsburgh,-80.2560925484,40.4958772052,"['Restaurants', 'Fast Food', 'Airports', 'Hotels & Travel']"

The lobby area can get a little tight, but at the same time it's nice to feel up close to the people who are making the drinks. They are dog friendly and occasionally host dog adoption events.

When we did get the attention of our server, he seemed irritated he had to wait on us. 

I understand at happy hour they get busy but message to the management, hire more servers. People are desperately looking for jobs and what do you pay them, like $2.30 an hour?

We needed a break from getting subs at different places and I chose to try something new.  This location opened recently.  It makes where I live about halfway between to Panera's but I decided to try this one.

Service was great at the counter, but the wait seemed long for the take out until I realized they had a number of people eating in who had ordered just before I got there.  I brought the sandwiches home and they were very good.  My wife had their Cuban chicken panini and I had the signature Steak and white cheddar.  They were both very good.  My panini had a fair kick from the horseradish spread on the sandwich.  With the sandwiches, I opted for the small bag of chips for each of us.

The order was packaged really nice in two small cardboard boxes.  My only complaint with this is there's really no way to tell which sandwich is which unless you peel back some of the bread to reveal the contents.  Some places put a numbered sticker on their sandwiches to match the items on your receipt.  The boxes at Panera have a place you could write the name.  I sent a suggestion to HQ and the responded that they'd look into it.

I'll return and I think I'll eat in.  The dining room is very nice and there's outdoor seating for when it's cooler.",2013-06-28,Las Vegas,-115.289161652,36.1632788522,"['Salad', 'Breakfast & Brunch', 'Bagels', 'Food', 'Soup', 'Restaurants', 'American (New)', 'Sandwiches']"

The sign in the elevator said brunch was offered from 11 to 3:30 but that was apparently just for the restaurant downstairs.  I'm honestly not sure if that's true.  We decided to eat anyway because we were starving.

We got some drinks and ordered an appetizer.  The appetizer was excellent, but that was the only positive point of the meal other than the weather and the view.  I ordered a veggie burger and it tasted / looked like a cheap patty that came out of a frozen package.  

After we ate we then proceeded to wait for what must have been at least a half hour before our bills came.  The place was filling up and our waiter looked busy but unfortunately we were tucked away in a corner that was essentially forgotten about.  The waiter was apologetic when he finally did return which was appreciated.

They serve really really great food, no question about that. However I just can't get over how expensive the bill can get. As some have suggested, pre-eat before you come here.

They are best known for their Butter Burgers and their Custard.  Me, personally, I will go there just for the custard.  I recommend a small or medium chocolate custard concrete mixer with brownie pieces.  Yummy!!!  Don't get a large, because that is way too much, you'll get a tummy ache.

My friend is from Wisconsin and will go here just for the cheese curds.

Can you really blame me? When the food is as good as this, it's almost a sin not to be. 

Let me explain, I had a hot veal sandwich and it was really good. With that, I had a Brio to wash it down. The bread was tasty, the veal was cooked perfectly (as expected), and the heat from the hot peppers was alright. I would have preferred it to have been a little hotter, but I'm not complaining.

After I had the veal sandwich I had a grill chicken sandwich (ok, I only ate half of it) and it was good. 

This begs the question, can they do no wrong? I'l have to go back, try something else and I'll let you know.

4,Chicken Shack,"I don't entirely know why, but I'm kind of obsessed with Chicken Shack. I'm rarely on that side of town, but have noticed it on my way to Ross J's. It looked kinda ghetto so I stayed away till a couple weeks ago when Ross J's was closed early. I'm glad I tried it because I'm a little addicted now.

I'm probably kind of biased because their plain wings taste just like when my mom makes korean chicken before she dips it in the sauce. Nostalgia is a funny thing, but I do think they're also just really good wings. 

Price is about $1/wing and many have mentioned that's overpriced, but that seems standard to me for restaurants - BWW is about the same. Chicken Shack also has huge drummies and wings, not broken or midget ones like a lot of other places. I'm a fatty, but I was full off of 6 wings because they're bigger and meatier. 

For sides, we've tried the cole slaw, baked beans, and fries - only the fries were really good crispy shoestrings, I'd pass on the rest and just stick with wings. For sauce my fav is the habanero honey (not that spicy) and garlic parm. The bbq and sweet chili were pretty standard, but I also liked the wings just plain because they had seasoning already. 

Service was great and the tables were clean the 2 times that I've been, with guys coming out to wipe down tables as soon as they're free. I hate nickel and diming - they charge for ranch/blue cheese and extra sauce, but what can you do.

I also agree with others who've said that their chicken fingers are dry - stick with the wings.",2014-06-17,Henderson,-115.072997733,36.0721934971,"['Chicken Wings', 'Restaurants']"

Cons?

3,Taco Tijuana,"Taste is delicious. Much more flavourful and portions of protein are at least 2x that of La Matraca. (A bit spicy -- ask for no salsa or on the side if your tolerance is low) 

Although you can order single tacos, you'll probably want 2-4 (depending on if this is lunch/dinner). I can eat 3 for dinner (and be right on the edge before full-on stuffed) and my husband can eat 4. Prices are more than other taco places though, at about $3.50 per taco. (In contrast to La Matraca which is about $8 for 3 I believe). But because the portions are much more generous here, we might actually end up spending less because we need less tacos to fill us up. I recall typically eating 4 tacos and half a sandwich at La Matraca for dinner...

But.... Service is very slow and the business is fairly disorganized. We waited ~30 min for 5 tacos and were told to-go orders are also capped at 6 tacos. I think there were only 2 employees there --one person manning the counter/serving/bus service, and one person in the back cooking/grilling. 

Definitely worth a spin for taste alone... Just plan a bit more time in your day for it since it may take awhile.",2015-05-09,Montréal,-73.6190661,45.468963099999996,"['Mexican', 'Restaurants']"

4,The King's Kitchen,"The Kings Kitchen was the answer to my ""where to eat after our quickie wedding"" prayers. The owner of the restaurant, Jim Noble, has a few other restaurants in Charlotte. I've eaten at one of them. Noble's, and it was fantastic. But a bit pricier than I wanted my new husband to have to deal with. I saw a link to The King's Kitchen, and after checking out the website, I was in love. The food was very southern, but I was immediately drawn to the salmon AND what they do for the community. So, I told my husband about it, made the reservation and anticipated a delicious meal.

After our short & sweet wedding, we headed downtown for dinner. We had reservations, but they weren't incredibly busy, so we probably would have been fine without one. We were seated quickly and our server greeted us promptly. He took our drink orders, came back and we ordered a few appetizers for the table. We ordered the deviled eggs & the pimento cheese. I can't comment on the pimento cheese, since I don't care for it and didn't try it, but the eggs were delicious. He also brought out two plates of biscuits with homemade strawberry jam and cornbread. Everyone raved about the cornbread. I had a biscuit with some jam and it was delicious, but nothing special.

The entrees came out quickly and everyone was more than pleased. I had the salmon with the pea risotto, which was fantastic. The salmon had a lime butter on top and the risotto was perfect. And the color was gorgeous and interesting. I was very pleased with the flavors of this dish (the salmon was some of the best I've ever had). 

Several members of our table ordered the pot roast. I had a bite of my husband's and it melted in my mouth. I've never had a roast that was that tender and had such great flavor. My new mother in law had the fried flounder. I had a bite of that and it was incredible as well.
Everyone loved their side items (the mashed potatoes, creamed corn & macaroni and cheese were HUGE hits), and almost everyone was pleased with their entrees. My new brother in law ordered the fried chicken, and while it looked delicious, he said their was so much grease it actually became unappetizing the more he looked at it. 

Other than the fried chicken, the dinner was a huge success, and a fantastic evening was had by all. And while I loved my delicious dinner, I love what the restaurant does for the community and that just makes me want to go there over and over again. Anyone in Charlotte needs to try it out.",2011-11-11,Charlotte,-80.84432199999999,35.227757000000004,"['American (Traditional)', 'Restaurants', 'Southern', 'Bakeries', 'Food']"

Great food, wonderful server... an all around great time!

Started out with Caramel Hazelnut coffee... yum

The hummus was wonderful and the lettuce wraps are a ""don't miss"" item!

I had the Jerk chicken sandwich.  The flavor was fantastic, but the bread was too large for the chicken breast.  The chili sauce and pineapple flavor to the sandwich made for a thoroughly enjoyable experience.

My girl had the Seafood chowder soup (loved it) and the eggplant (she said it was OK, but nothing to write home about)

3,The Buffet at ARIA,"Went for Dinner for the Maine Lobster for 2 and unlimited Wine. almost $40 for dinner

Maine Lobster wasnt bad, but they cleared our table before I can tell them to stop. The Wine, only two choices, I got the White Wine. First time drinking Wine so I couldnt take advantage of the unlimited wine because I did not like how it tasted.

Pretty small selections, seems as if there werent a lot of selections. I mostly ate the clams/mussels and they were DELICIOUS! They had the mini salad cup things next to the mussels and they were GOOD! well the one with the crumble cheese. The crab wasnt bad it was split in half so less hassle for us. Sushi was normal. Smoked salmon tasted like ham. The prime rib was pretty good. The custom made pasta need something im not sure what, but its cool how you can customize your own pasta.  Desserts, I loved how they had chocolate covered strawberries and creme brulee. Cookies werent bad, the mini cup desserts were good.

1,Rosati's Pizza,"For some reason my co-workers continue to want to order food from this restaurant every Friday when the boss is buying. All free lunches have their tradeoffs, and for me, this one is no longer worth it. On a couple of occasions I have tried the individual pizzas, which taste a lot like the cardboard they come in. One of my office mates raves about the meat ravioli; tried that once and as another reviewer indicated, it tasted like it came out of a can. 

I am going out to lunch today and buying my own food (better to escape the smell of raw onions one of these ""ladies"" likes to cram onto her meatball sub). 

In the several times I have tried to order off this menu it seems like something listed doesn't actually exist in their restaurant. No, we don't have sun dried tomatoes; no, we don't have balsamic dressing... 

Today I thought I would just get a salad, but I didn't want the heavy garlicky dressing that they usually thrust upon you and asked for olive oil instead. I was advised they don't have olive oil. I understand maybe in this neighborhood the sun dried tomatoes aren't a popular item, that they might be out of balsamic (actually I don't really because, although they have been listed on the print and online menu for the last 8 months, they never have had those effing tomatoes). However, how can any Italian restaurant not have olive oil?

The descriptions for a couple of their dressings mention that they are made in house. Perhaps these people use canola oil in their dressings rather than olive oil, which sounds kind of Italian. It's actually Canadian - in case you were wondering.",2012-09-21,Phoenix,-112.03155159999999,33.3794083,"['Pizza', 'Restaurants']"

5,Bella Vista,"As a lot of the reviews suggest, this is a spot for a special occasion.

It was still really nice inside and the view I mean...come on. 

I got here early with my mom while we waited for the rest of my family and had a super good espresso martini. Then as my family arrived we were seated and began dinner. The waitress was awesome, just attentive enough and was really accommodating. We had such good food, I got 3 lobster tails and they were perfectly prepared. 

I could not think of anything I would change about the time I dined here, and I can't wait to go back when my little brother graduates from college just to eat here again! So props to Bella Vista.",2013-11-17,Pittsburgh,-80.01828,40.438047,"['Restaurants', 'Italian']"
2,Gordon Ramsay Steak,"My wife and I had high expectations since we've seen Chef Gordon Ramsey's attention to detail on tv. Let's just call that Hollywood hype. The restaurant is in the Paris Hotel which is nice. We got there a bit early (8:30) for our 9:00 reservation and let the hostess know. She said it would be another 15 minutes and that we should wait at the bar. We decided to walk around instead and came back at 8:45. The same hostess says it will be another 15 minutes and again directs us to the bar. We walked around  until 9:00. The hostess says it will be a few more minutes as they are setting up the table before disappearing in the back. You can guess where she tried to send us before leaving. 10 minutes later, she reappears surprised to see that we haven't given up and gone to the bar. All the while there are 5 or 6 snobby hostesses just standing there.

Ok Vegas restaurants, listen up,.... pissing off your customers right off bat by lying to them about how long the wait will be as a weak-sauced ploy to get them to buy some $18.00 foo foo drinks at your bar is not a good start. Another hostess finally walked us in through the ""London Tunnel"" and pointed out the obnoxious red neon chaos on the ceiling (supposed to represent Chef Ramsey's hand movements). There was some loud 80's music playing and the decore looked like a club scene from Scarface.

We went with the basics since this is a steakhouse. My wife ordered the foie gras appetizer and I got the lobster stuffed with chorizo. The foie gras was ok, but it needed something else to balance the dish. My lobster was good but strange as appetizer (imagine tiny lobster tail with carrots). The entrees were the 8 oz wagyu eye and the 24 oz ribeye. The wagyu was good but the ribeye was flat and basic. Not what I was expecting. We finished the meal with a sticky toffee cake that was very good. Probably the best part of the meal. Overall, this place needs to lose the 5 snobby hostesses and 80's Studio 54 decor to focus on the food.",2015-09-20,Las Vegas,-115.17127035700001,36.1128823357,"['Restaurants', 'Steakhouses', 'American (New)']"
3,SUSHISAMBA - Las Vegas,"I had high hopes for this place, mainly because my mother, who I've taken to many great places in Chinatown, went to Sushi Samba and claimed it was the best meal she's ever had. So even though I knew it was expensive, if she said it was worth it I was believing her. 

First off, it was crazy loud in the place, and it was very hard for us (especially my grandfather) to hear anything that was going on. But it's a strip restaurant I get it. We ordered drinks, oysters, and the heirloom tomato salad. I didn't eat much of any of those dishes, but for dinner we each ordered a roll: the neo Tokyo, sasa hand roll, and I had the chef special which was tempura shrimp, tuna, and cheese on top. All of the rolls were pretty bland and my roll was especially chewy with the cheese on top. (I knew sushi wasn't supposed to have cheese yet it sounded intriguing.) 

For other small plates we ordered the hamachi Kama, tempura green beans, and scallops with Peruvian corn which everyone raves about. The best by far was the tempura. I have never had Peruvian corn but it was very big and sort of hard. The scallops didn't have any taste. 

My biggest complaint about the restaurant is that we felt that they were constantly trying to take our plates away and clear the table. I understand it's a tapas restaurant so food comes quickly but once all our dishes were there they kept asking to clear plates that still had food on them. Just felt like they wanted to crank out as many tables as they could that night. They did end up giving us complimentary ice cream pops which was nice, but I don't think I'll be going back.

The fish tacos are pretty spectacular and are typically my order when I am there; The Don cocktail is also a favorite.  I would also recommend getting the tofu cracklins as an appetizer - I am not a tofu lover, but these are incredible.  You also cannot go wrong with the Kaya burger, conch fritters, or the chicken entree.  The pulled pork quesadilla is pretty spicy, so if you don't like a lot of heat in your food, I would recommend against that.

5,Tamarind Savoring India,"We'd been meaning to try Tamarind for some time but didn't get around to it until this evening, and I am elated to tell you all that everything we had from starter to main to end was -- to put it simply -- a treat.

I am not Sherlock Holmes and thus am no expert on spices. My (damned) acid reflux also makes partaking in painfully high spice levels an act of poor judgement. I also like to taste what I am eating aside from seed-borne heat. The spice fiends of the Yelposphere who think that food is bland and worthless unless it deadens their tongues may scoff at my moderate intake of all things peppery, but I prefer my food to be a pleasure to consume, not an exercise in masochism. Having mentioned that, I found no issues with the pungency of what I ate.  

In regards to my entree, that being Lamb Korma, I asked for a 5 and got something that playfully nibbled at my tastebuds without overtaking the other components of the dish. Rich and succulent as a Hungarian ghoulash, the Korma reminded me of an even creamier interpretation of the more conventional (and famous?) Lamb Curry. A squiggly line of what I assume was yogurt was drizzled atop the gravy for presentation. The lamb, braised exquisitely, was as delicate and suety as the zenith of pulled pork. Exactly what spices were in the Korma, I couldn't tell you, but they were there, hiding underneath the buttery flavors and even permeating the avocado and walnut-colored room. Accentuating everything, usurping nothing, the essences were indescribable yet omnipresent. 

Kay's Tikka Masala cruised on a track parallel to the Korma, but included chicken, tomato, and onions to liven it up further. Kay was unable to finish her portion, so I...intervened. Both dishes were so luscious, when our excellent, friendly, and (interestingly enough) non-Indian server came by our table to see how our dinner was proceeding, I merely looked at her, closed my eyes, hummed, and swayed, much to her amusement and relief (the poor lass was dealing with a difficult party as we dined). 

Our first course consisted of the savorily tangy bread pudding vs. falafel of Dahi Vada. The fritters of lentil could have been a dessert had there been milk and sugar involved, but instead, both of the large ""fried donuts"" came to us in a pool of raita (a white yogurt sauce) and embellished with carrot shards and other vegetables. Velvety and served chilled, I felt that this would be the dish to serve with or after something particularly piquant. Nonetheless, the weightless patties were an ideal counterbalance to the entree.

Rather than go with Naan, that staple of Indian cuisine I've enjoyed countless times, I opted for its billowy, crisp, hot fat-baptized variant in Batura. The most savorous fried dough in all of gastronomy, the gilded bread itself was feather-light, had bubbles all through it, and revealed a hollow interior when pulled apart to dip into and soak up whatever we pleased. If any Indian restaurant decided to open a booth at a carnival, they'll do well to make plenty of Batura for it is fair food that is at once familiar and exotic. I have had Batura before, but it had been so long that I had forgotten what it was called. Tonight's dinner was a pleasant and decadent refresher course on this Asiatic sopapilla. 

I almost went with an Indian dessert such as Rasmalai to conclude the evening's experience, but when I found out that Tamarind makes their own cakes in their own bakery, I just had to take a pop at one. Feeling like chocolate cake (Tamarind has a wide assortment), we each went for just that and were pleased to find that it was moist, constructed ornately with multiple layers, ethereal in texture, and iced with an equally airy coffee-tinged frosting that resembled mousse. We were assured by our server that Tamarind does not buy their cakes elsewhere, and I am still trying to tell myself that I did in fact have myself a truly blissful cut of chocolate cake...from an Indian restaurant.  How common is that? 

Savoring India, indeed. Drive up that winding road to find the hidden shopping plaza in the suburban sky and deliver thyselves unto culinary Vaikuntha.",2012-12-03,Pittsburgh,-80.0724608,40.3905672,"['Bakeries', 'Restaurants', 'Pakistani', 'Food', 'Indian']"

1,Hobak Korean BBQ,"This was my favorite restaurant. Amazing food and great service. But today they're very busy and service was beyond terrible. The waitress left in the middle of our meal, never to be seen again. We had to fetch multiple others to get some service: more water, bill, to go boxes, dessert. And the expensive meat our waitress was in the process of cooking - burnt. 

Then the hostess proposed to charge an 18% gratuity because we're a table of 6. Proceeded to say then that since one of us was a baby, they would waive this rule. When I didn't leave a tip - she asked if I wanted to tip the server, I responded that we didn't get any service, so no. She then reminded me that she didn't charge us 18% gratuity! All of this is after my parents - whom I was treating - walked out.  So I had this conversation while I'm waiting at the register as the hostess ran out of printing paper and didn't know how to replace it with the new roll for a while.

From inside out they tried to use the same ingredients/noodles as their original store in Japan(even the same style of bowl in blue, and the quantity of noodle, pork etc......) However the noodle doesn't turn out as good as I imagine.  Not to get me wrong the egg noodle(ramen) is of high quality, very rich in egg flavour, but texture not as good as Kinton and Sansotei.  I was looking into the kitchen to see how they cook the noodle, and find out that the chef didn't drain out all the excess water after they cook the noodle, which is one of the key factor of affecting the texture of it.

The soup base is ok, not the best comparing to Sansotei, love the combo that comes with a bowl of rice with salmon roe on it, although a little pricy for that.  The pork is good too, very tender and juicy.  I did return for a 2nd time, but the noodle texture turns out to be exactly the same as first time which dissappoint me a bit~~",2013-11-27,Toronto,-79.37749958,43.656321731400006,"['Ramen', 'Restaurants', 'Japanese', 'Noodles']"

4,Jack Astor's Bar & Grill,"Huge fan of this Jack's. It's actually my favorite so far. Food is the same it always is -  my favorite is bruschetta. They honestly have the most amazing bruschetta I have ever had in my life...It's so packed with basil, tomatoes, feta, balsamic and creamy dressing, and onions. UGH! Want. Right. Now.

Location is perfect, the area was missing a nice roof top patio. It's spacious, full of servers and they're all mad nice.

The only problem is the lineup. Friday night, any time after 6pm - GOOD LUCK getting a seat anywhere in the restaurant, and you can forget about the roof top all together. 

Bar has a huge screen if you wanna watch anything. Usually the main ""event"" (whether it's Friday night football or a big Jay's game) is on the big screen and the rest of the stuff, like cricket...and water polo... are on the tiny screens surrounding it. It's pricey - it's Jack's after all. I would still recommend this if you're anywhere in the Sheppard/Finch area and need a place to get drunk.

5,Veggie House,"I loved this place.

The service was amazing for casual dining. The ladies all helped us, were constantly smiling, and always checked up on us. They refilled drinks promptly, they took requests for sharing plates and napkins quickly. It truly was a great first experience.

I've heard great things about ""fake meat"". I've heard that their are delicious fried chicken sandwiches at Veggie places that rival the real thing.

I willingly tried out veggie house for lunch with two friends.

They have a large menu of vegan and vegetarian dishes. Many of them feature tofu, veggies, and ""fake meat"". Sorry I can't figure out a better sounding phrase.

Anyways their lunch special comes with soup, brown or white rice, and an entree. I don't remember the price but the lunch portions of the items were big! I want to say it was $7-$8 for their lunch special.

Between the here of us we had beef and broccoli, Kung pao beef, and their famous crispy beef.

All of the entrees were served with their traditional veggies. Like the Kung pao had water chestnuts, onions, ect,

The veggies on my beef and broccoli were a large portion. All of their ingredients are fresh. 

And let me get to the meat. Upon first bite it truly is a great substitute to meat. It really does taste relatively close to the real thing. They have the texture right. All of the dishes had the same traditional flavors you'd expect. The crispy beef was the least like beef IMO since it is fried it tasted more like fried batter. It was still tasty. Their brown rice was cooked perfectly. The soup had a very mild flavor. It was like a veggie broth.

Last we had a vegan pumpkin cheesecake. It was a good ending to the meal. It was light, sweet, and pumpkiny. I still prefer regular cheesecake.

Am I a convert? No. It did make me rethink all the salt and meat I eat. Will I come back here and was the food good? Yes!

1,Shiloh Grill,"My last review is, to this day, still the worst review I have given for the worst service I have ever received. Shiloh Grill has proved a disappointment yet again and this review still stands true. Now that we live on Mount Washington (we moved about 5 months ago) I have been avoiding it due to our previous visit. Today our friend suggested it so 4 of us went out together. It wasn't busy, many open tables but we sat outside which also had many open tables. After getting our water, our waiter said he'd be back to take our orders. I ordered first and asked for the calamari. He said they were out. I actually began to laugh thinking it was a joke due to our last visit. Before anyone spoke he said, ""we just had a table of 80 and they cleared us out on food."" Please tell me why you wouldn't tell us this right when we sat down, not nearly 20 minutes later? My boyfriend then said, ""what do you have? I was going to get the weasel (or something titled that, I just know it was a portobello sandwich), do you have that?"" Our wait told us they did not have that and really were ""out of everything"". This was the second time I gave Shiloh Grill a chance and I WILL NEVER GO BACK. Why is your kitchen open if you have no food? I understand large parties. But a party of 80? You weren't prepared? Even so, you should have food for 80 people in a night. I have worked years in the restaurant business so I understand issues beyond control but to not tell us when you gave us a menu? Maybe the owners of Shiloh Grill should worry more about customer service and actually being a worthy restaurant than all of their unoriginal and frankly worthless puns that fall extremely short just like their service and their food. I truly think this is a joke. At least they're consistent.

P.S.

3,Sushi Sky Japanese Restaurant,"Service at this place is incredibly hit or miss - usually more MISS than hit no doubt.  Being ignored is heavily easy to do!  Equally easy is receiving the wrong order.

The food itself is pretty decent for a budget shop!  No complaints on the food other than it often takes a little bit of time, isn't always right (ie. they don't bring what you ordered they bring something else all together) and they lack a bit of the variety a few other places have.

If you are looking for a fine dinning experience - this is NOT your place.  If you are craving sushi, have 10 bucks in your pocket and a little bit of time, stop in!  We frequently quite regularly - despite the bad service the quality is consistent.

Last time we dinned in we did NOT leave a tip due to the insanity that was the service (no service, had to walk from back of restaurant to front of restaurant 3 times to fetch a server - didn't bring what we ordered even though we ordered by the item name not menu number, hard to mix that one up, took an exceeding amount of time to make/deliver food, the days wait staff were quite kirt) upon paying the woman taking our money had the audacity to say ""oh...mam you didn't include a tip, give me your card back and we'll do it again""  A tip is not a legal right, it's an earned reward!

5,Famous Dave's Barbeque - Las Vegas,"I still had $12 on my gift gard so I stopped by and grabbed a BURGER on the way home since this week I had already tried all the BBQ.

It was a tough choice but I went for the Devil's Spit Bacon Burger!

No Suprise! It was one of the best burgers I have ever eaten. 

Cooked to perfection medium well with a nice layer of bbq sauce cooked into it 

Topped with a toasted bun & cheese,crispy bacon,lettuce,tomato and crunchy Hell-Fire pickles.

I don't think I took 1 breath until this thing was GONE!

I can't wait to go back for another! Maybe they need a drive-thru?

3,Hue Thai,"Hue Thai is one of those places that sell a lot variety of food and most of them are decent (not great, but). Their menu are composed most of Viet food and some Thai food. They are famous for Banh Mi (Vietnamese sandwich), which I think is good. 

Now here is why they deserve 3 stars instead of 4. First their price is a little higher than most other Vietnamese restaurant. Second, I found little roaches and ants near the area where they stack booster seat and high chairs. One time I went there to grab a booster seat, as soon as I picked up one of the seat, a bunch of roaches and ants started running out from underneath. It was so gross that I haven't back since. Now think about it this way, if there's so much of roaches here, imagine what their kitchen looks like. Anyway, enough detail about this, let move on to why not 2 stars. Well, I guess b/c sometimes I have to accept the fact that there are a lot of restaurants out there that don't put hygiene in their priority list (watch 20/20 lately? ) Overall, 2 and 1/2 stars.",2011-02-09,Las Vegas,-115.211199,36.125587,"['Vietnamese', 'Restaurants', 'Chinese', 'Thai']"

Our server was decent. She was nice and constantly checked on us. She wasn't a great server but not the worst.  To top it off a young teenager was walking around in inappropriate clothing near the food area. I didn't come in to see a young girl who clearly works here showing too much skin.

2,Crown Prince Fine Dining & Banquet,"I suggest reading the 3-star reviews and below on Crown Prince before you decide to go, because I paid more attention to the 3-star and above reviews and after my experience there I feel that I should've taken my own suggestion to avoid a colossal letdown. 

Yesterday was my first time visiting this restaurant and I picked an awesome day to try it out: Chinese New Year Day!  I actually went early in the morning before they opened their doors at 9:00 AM, and there was already a line up!  As soon as the doors open people just started flooding in and I knew at that point not to expect too much on this visit.

I ordered 5 items of dim sum and the last one arrived at my table almost 1 hour  after I had placed the order. Maybe it was a special dish they make in batches at a certain time. It was the crispy pumkin with mushroom something-something.  Anyways, one minute after that dish arrived at my table, one of the managers came up to me and said that I had to pay my bill soon cuz I've been sitting for over an hour and I can't take my sweet time to eat  cuz it was new years.  Of course, this conversation happened in Cantonese. I thought to myself, WTF?  I understand they wanna turn tables but there's a better way to ask.  Some restaurants place the bill on your table and say thank you.  

If that conversation hadn't happened, I would've given this restaurant a three-star at most just for the food and somewhat okay service.  To be fair, there was an older manager who seems to have more experience in the restaurant business that was more helpful.  When I was looking around to flag someone, he took notice and  came up to my table to ask me what I needed. I'm not going to blow this incident out of proportion but it definitely leaves a bad taste in my mouth to be accused of squatting when I was waiting for the last dish to come out. It's not my fault their kitchen is slow.

That issue aside, the food is okay and they're priced okay as well at $2.80 for S, M, L and they have some unique items on their menu.  I noticed a lot of pumpkin based dim sum and I really wanted to try the puff pastry durian dessert thing but I didn't get the chance cuz the manager that tried to kick me out totally spoiled my mood.  

Finally, don't let the decor fool you. This restaurant is not as ""upscale"" as it looks; it's all a facade to make people feel comfortable about paying more for what is essentially less.  Fortunately, it doesn't work on me.  That's why I chose to go for dim sum.  I would be dumb to order off of their dinner menu. When you strip away the decor, it exposes the real substance of the restaurant and there's really not much there to differentiate this restaurant from others.  

On a side note, I wish restaurants like Crown Prince and Casa Imperial (possibly related or sharing notes) could be more original with their decor.  Some people associate this classic style with ""upscale"" and ""elegance"" but it looks out of place to me in the 21st century.  Note to the owners of Crown Prince: if you're gonna open another restaurant, please for the sake of this city take notes from the restaurants in Asia who have mastered the art of modern elegance and do your part in bringing Chinese restaurants in Toronto up to the 21st century--not down.

Bottom line, food is acceptable and the prices for dim sum are reasonable, which is probably why this place is busy, but everything else is lacking.  I most likely won't go back.",2013-02-11,Toronto,-79.3384604817,43.806532446800006,"['Chinese', 'Restaurants', 'Dim Sum']"

Our food wasn't terrible but it wasn't good enough to want to go back. Our server never once checked on us during our entrée. When she finally did come back, we asked for a box bc we wanted to go, another 15 min to get that.

That. is. awful. If someone messes up that often, she should no longer work there or fill a hostess position.

5,Rollin Smoke Barbeque,"Vegas is such a minefield as far as its restaurants are concerned, with so many meals beginning with high expectations but ending in disappointment, that I wanted to say a few words about a place that I feel is one of the absolute gems of the Vegas culinary landscape.

I've eaten at Rollin' Smoke BBQ twice now, and left both times feeling as though I'd eaten some of the best BBQ of my life. I'm a true lover of good BBQ and have even taken pilgrimages to places like Memphis, TN and Lockhart, TX in search of the country's best. I feel I have a good frame of reference for evaluating what good BBQ tastes like, and, let me assure you, Rollin' Smoke is damned good BBQ!

Everything I've tried on the menu has been excellent, but the dishes I dream about are the smoked meatloaf--which I have to say may be the single best meatloaf dish I've ever eaten--and the burnt ends, waffle fries and corn fritters. The ribs, chicken and everything else is excellent, but the above dishes were my favorites.

Las Vegas is frankly very lucky to have BBQ of this caliber, as very few cities in America do. The manager is super friendly, and the whole staff is very friendly and accommodating. They also give a discount to locals, showing that they appreciate those of us who live here and support these businesses on a regular basis.

I know I'm going to leave with a smile on my face every time I eat here, and I cannot recommend this place highly enough. Unlike many on Yelp, I don't give out five-star ratings easily, but Rollin' Smoke has earned it! Please support this great Las Vegas restaurant! My only complaint is that they close at 8pm Mon-Fri, but the most important thing is that their food is truly outstanding!",2016-07-29,Las Vegas,-115.177067,36.1321763,"['Restaurants', 'Burgers', 'Soul Food', 'Barbeque']"

As far as taste and quality of sushi it was just OK. I'm sure if you are the kind of person who just wants a California roll for your ""sushi experience"" this place will do but  if you are thinking about getting AYCE DO NOT GO HERE. You will have to keep ordering the same things every time you will not get your complete order. You will leave here frustrated and still hungry like myself and the rest of my group did.

Everything Coronado serves up, from its pepper-crusted sirloin with carmelized jalapenos and onions to their cafe meatloaf with sauteed pepper, squash, mushroom, and a balsamic reduction, to their home-made sticky buns on Saturday mornings is to die for.

2,Due Forni,"I went for the first time on Friday night with my boyfriend and our friend.  2 beers, 2 glasses of wine, mozarella, a salad and a pizza for $74.  The price point was too high for our taste.

The place has a cool vibe.  We sat outside, under the heat lamps, and had a laugh over the bright orange plastic chairs, which reminded all of us of the chairs in elementary school.  The dark wood, which so many people find ""modern"" is straight out of the late 60s, early 70s, especially with the ""burnt orange"" chairs.  My aunt's fridge was the same exact color.

The service was awesome, as one would expect it to be in a new restaurant.  Everyone was VERY knowledgeable and helpful, which we greatly appreciated.

We split the panzanella salad, which was fine, but certainly not spectacular. We did all appreciate the freshness of the ingredients.  

We then split a classica mozarella bar with the artichoke hearts.  The mozarella was good, the artichoke hearts were completely underwhelming.  The quantity of them was sad, sad, sad, and they were very lightly seasoned (to put it mildly, we found it bland.)

Last, our pizza.  We had the Prosciutto e Rucola on the Neopolitan crust, as was recommended by our server.  The crust was the perfect blend of crunchy and chewy, the prosciutto was plentiful, and the flavor was, well, pretty bland.  There was so little smoked mozarella that I don't think I even had a bite of it on my slice.  

We contemplated desserts, but with only 3 choices, and none of them all that appealing to us, we decided against it.  

We were kinda bummed by the lack-luster performance, as we frequently walk to Rachel's for breakfast and lunch, and Hokkaido for dinner, and we were excited to have a cool place to hang out and eat some tasty food.  But the reality is, for the price and the mediocre food, I don't see us going there again any time soon.  

I much prefer going to Nora's on Flamingo and Jones for salad, pizza and wine.  Their food is superior, and I don't leave there hungry.",2011-03-07,Las Vegas,-115.3252217,36.124840500000005,"['Bars', 'Nightlife', 'Pizza', 'Italian', 'Wine Bars', 'Restaurants']"

3,Surco Peruvian Cuisine,"This is a tough one. I live in the neighborhood and I love Peruvian food and this food was as good as I've had. I had the chicken sandwich with tacu tacu and it was awesome. The chicken was perfect: super moist and perfectly seasoned. The whole sandwich was sort of a piece of art. It's clear that whoever is in the kitchen takes pride in their work and has the chops of a chef and not a line cook. The interior was also very comfortable and a huge upgrade from the previous business.

All that being said, I was in complete disbelief at the pricing. I won't say that the food wasn't worth it, but in this neighborhood, at that location, in this town, I don't see this working. My chicken sandwich was just about the least expensive item on the menu at $13. Most of the entrees were $16-25 and I think dessert (also amazing) was $8 or $9. I had my two sons along and they actually had two items available in a children's section. They both got the salchipapas (hot dog and fries) for $8. To be fair, they did serve a really nice squash soup to each of us included with our entrees.

I'm not sure who's behind the business side of the restaurant, but I have a feeling they have some restaurant experience in a big city. They seem a little out of touch with the Madison scene. Most places with really good food have sandwiches available in the $8-10 range with entrees in the $9-13 range. You really need to venture downtown to start pushing these kind of prices and you need to have a location that isn't a rundown, nondescript, white house.

I don't think there's any way this model is going to work at this location. Besides one couple at the end of our stay, we were the only diners between 5:45-6:45 on a Friday night. I do think a restaurant (and even a Peruvian restaurant) could be successful here, but it's going to need to be able to serve it's surrounding neighborhoods. The people around here just aren't gonna opt for these prices, regardless of the food quality. Bring your prices down to match what's available on Atwood and think about the lunch crowd too. Reasonably priced sandwiches to go would have a strong market at that location. I really want to support you guys and this should be a regular joint for my family of four, but at these prices, it ain't happenin'.",2013-12-21,Madison,-89.317665,43.08356,"['Restaurants', 'Peruvian']"

So far as I can tell, Panera is a pseudo-trendy food stand aimed at the same suburban yuppies that shop for music from Starbucks and proudly drive Ford Escape Hybrids.  The pastries are decent at best but incredibly overpriced.  You can get donuts and cookies that are just as good for less than half the price at the Giant Eagle across the street.   And how about the food?  Decent soup, shitty little sandwiches, and again (as if it's a dominant theme), incredibly overpriced.

I guess that mark-up is for the ""hip""-ness factor?

Panera always reminds me of eating lunch in elementary school, back when those Lunchable things were fashionable.  I begged and begged my mom to buy me those things for my lunch because they were cool, but once I actually ate it, I felt cheated and unfulfilled.

2,Shake Shack,"Ney York, is this all you got? I can't believe people are comparing this place to In-N-Out Burger. You can get a Double-Double combo for about $6 bucks at In-N-Out while a Double Shack Burger is $8 bucks a la carte. 

I ordered the Shack Stack which is the cheeseburger with the cheese stuffed mushroom all in one. $10 bucks. 

Burger was too salty. I couldn't taste the meat due to the giant battered and cheesy stuffed mushroom overpowering the meat. So the meat to cheese to bun ratio was way off in this burger. Does not live up to my expectation of what a $10 dollar burger should taste like.

Girlfriend ordered the double Smoke Shack: Double bacon cheeseburger. $10 bucks.

Burger again was too salty. She got 2 patties so this time the meat to bun ratio was much better. The pickled red peppers with its acidity balanced well with the richness of the melted cheese and bacon. Not a bad burger but not a $10 dollar burger by any means.

Fries: Probably the highlight of the meal. These are crinkle cut fries with just the right amount of crunch on the outside and they are thick enough that you get some chewy potato on the inside. Decent sized portion for $3 bucks.

Summary: Burgers are overpriced by $4 bucks. If you're comparing this to In-N-Out then do yourself a favor and get In-N-Out, you get the same size/type of burger at the price that it's worth. 

If I was to spend $10 on a burger, then I'd go to Bachi Burger instead. Take notes Shack Shack, Bachi Burger is what a $10 burger should look and taste like.

TLDR: $10 price tag, $5 dollar burger.",2015-01-20,Las Vegas,-115.173450261,36.103061259499995,"['Burgers', 'Restaurants', 'American (New)']"

And take out, don't get me started they don't even pretend to listen to spice levels or give reasonable pickup time estimates.

Walking in, there was one other person and he just came to get his food to go. By the time I left it was crowded...and I don't know why.

Customer Service: Great. You go to the register, you order, you pay, you pick up a number and a drink and you sit down. The cashier/waitress came around to give all the patrons napkins, I didn't really understand why because my food wasn't even on the table yet but um great.

Food: Sucks. You can ask for your burger medium-rare but there are no guarantees you will get it as such. I asked for and got mine medium-rare and it TASTED good but the texture was all wrong. It was dry, dry, dry and dry. The poutine? A salty mess. The fries were actually well fried and the cheese curds were squeaky but that disgusting gravy ruined it all.

We started with 2 glasses of red wine and a meatball appetizer that was reminiscent of dining at a South Philadelphia Italian restaurant. The meatballs were accompanied by warm bread, which we used to sop up the ""gravy."" 

Osso Bocco is my favorite dish and this was the best I ever had. Veal shanks aren't normally meaty, but these were. The high quality of the veal was immediately recognizable and the portion was generous, as well. 

My wife ordered veal picante, which was also good, but we both agreed that the osso bocco was the star of the evening. 

When we considered the overall experience, the price was not unreasonable. 
The atmosphere was relaxing and conducive to leisurely dining, which is a rarity in Las Vegas. The service was right up there, too.

2,CK's Tavern & Grill,"My husband and I have been coming to CK's for a few years.  I must admit, it has declined over the years.  A Bar Rescue is in order.  Recently on our last few visits we have noticed an increasing displacement in our experience.  Last night was the defining experience to seek yelp to express our displacement. 
Here are some of our dislikes:  The food is not fresh.
1.  We ordered the potato skins.  they were not fully cooked and very dry- difficult to cut and chew.  We returned them -the 2nd plate replacing them were still difficult to eat they were dry. 
2. We ordered the meat loaf dinner.  the meatloaf was dry and the barbecue sauce used on it was so bitter and too spicy to eat. the mashed potatoes listed on the menu were not the mashed potatoes served.  The mashed potatoes were plain and tasted bland. 
3.  The server appearance was unkept.  hair unkept and clothing not professional.  The server was inexperienced and did not pay attention to our needs. We witnessed her walking in circles through her section and not checking in with her customers.  food not brought out in a timely fashion.   We ordered our drinks and she forgot my husband's drink and we sat and waited until she came over.  She did not clear off our table after serving us, leaving dirty plates and paper on our table.  
4.  The Bar and seating area appeared dirty and unkept. behind the bar it appeared unkept and unorganized. 

I hope the owners read this and find a solution

4,Chaya Japanese Cuisine,"SETTING:
Probably the most authentic Japanese as you can get in Pittsburgh. From the get-go, I noticed the flower arrangements, the wooden tables and furniture, and the Japanese music lightly playing in the background. Chaya was beautiful and the establishment made quite the impression. The traditional decor and warm atmosphere was exactly what I needed to help me relax and enjoy some Japanese comfort food. 

FOOD:
We shared the Regular Sushi & Sashimi Combination. The course starts with a miso soup and small salad, then a small karaage (japanese fried chicken). Finally the platter comes out, an assortment of sashimi (tuna, salmon, shrimp, etc) and california rolls. 

Miso soup and salad were pretty standard, as they should be. I love chicken karaage, so I was a bit disappointed that it was a bit small (four bite-sized pieces). That being said, they do a great job with creating a tender and juicy appetizer. The Sushi and Sashimi combo definitely featured fresh and good quality sashimi and sushi. Overall, it's not exactly filling if you're sharing between two hungry people, but is is a perfectly light dinner. 

SERVICE:
Kind and professional staff. They are very attentive and come by when every dish is served to ask how we like it and if we need more water. I believe all the waitresses and the sushi chef are Japanese as well, and they were very gentle and created a wonderful dining experience for us.

IMPRESSIONS:
As much as my hungry stomach may disagree, particularly when it hijacks my mind's sound decision-making, I'm always about quality over quantity. Chaya is quality. Not just the food, but from top to bottom. The atmosphere, the staff, and of course, their dishes all create a remarkable casual dining experience.",2015-03-04,Pittsburgh,-79.92313399999999,40.4338841,"['Restaurants', 'Japanese', 'Sushi Bars', 'Soup']"

All items were good, but the butcher's platter was the winner. For two people, it worked out well. We definitely could have gone without the pretzel bites, but oh well!

We picked it up and took it home, only to find out there were no tortillas! We had to drive several miles back for more. Last night was our second poor experience with this location. I observed a customer returning a wrongly made order. I ordered cheese enchiladas with rice and beans. I am vegetarian and do not enjoy meat (one of the reasons I love Rubios). My enchilada was served to me stuffed full of chicken. I returned the order and was given a replacement plate with cheese enchiladas. Looking forward to my meal, finally, I started to eat. They were out of forks so i had to use a spoon. The rice was half-cooked and still crunchy, and did not seem to have any flavor.

4,Gangster Burger,"I was looking for new burger places in downtown Toronto and this place appealed to me because of the personality on their website. 

I went in and tried the El Chapo. Their menu consists of burgers named after famous gangsters. Because it is a small joint, you get to see the cook make the burger in front of you. While waiting, I took in the surroundings. The restaurant has very solid decor, further accentuating its strong personality. 

The burger itself was fantastic. I was pleasantly surprised by the caramelized jalapeños in my burger and added another level of flavour. The other burgers also some have creative ideas on it so make sure to try it before it gets super popular!",2015-06-06,Toronto,-79.4023666382,43.647441863999994,"['Fast Food', 'Restaurants', 'Burgers']"

4,Wingstop,"Let's start with this - the wings are really good. They have a good selection of sauces, sure to please everyone. The wings are a little smaller than I'm accustomed to but that doesn't distract from the fact that they are SUPER tasty! I LOVED the Atomic sauce. Oh man, I'd like to take home a gallon of that - but it might eat its way through whatever container it was put in...Hmm. The sides are delightful, especially the bourbon baked beans. How can that not be good? Home made goodness like all the other sides and you can clearly tell. The cole slaw is amazing and so is the potato salad.

But what makes this place is the people here. The whole team seems genuinely committed to making sure things are done right, that the food is top notch and that the service is exactly what you'd expect. The manager is a pure delight and she is super friendly. After being in business only 3 months they seemed to have hit a good stride and have things cranking very well. Their plans to expand could have some great wings near your neighborhood very soon. And if they do? Get there. Get some.

5,Switch Restaurant & Wine Bar,"I'm ranking this primarily on the food and what I think is some great potential... also based on the fact that I really want them to do well.

Anyway, I've been to Switch I think five or six times now in the past month (whenever I'm in Phoenix for work) mainly because it's about 2 blocks from the office. I've done both take-out and dine-in, and have only come away with questionable service once. Even then, the food is spot-on. In the evenings, the whole area is sorta dead, especially with the light-rail construction, so I'm sure that's not helping out. But the several times I've been there for lunch, it's been pretty packed and have even had to wait for a table once or twice (just a few minutes).

So, so far...

Appetizers:
- Garlic hummus. the waiter says it's ""kick ass,"" and it was. Love the roasted pepper and artichokes on the side
- Turkey Mac'n'Cheese. Wasn't my favorite, but pretty creamy nonetheless.

Salads and Soup:
-Sangria Salad with chicken (you can add chicken, beef, turkey, ham, tuna salad, salmon, or lobster salad to any of the salads). Anyway, rather fruity with grapes, apples, and strawberries. Great flavor combination.
-Super Chop Salad with lobster. Stuff is just piled on. Love it.
In general, the salads are pretty big and filling. Only gotten the soup of the day (which changes regularly as the name implies). Had a duck and mushroom soup the other day. A little on the salty side, but I can't say no to duck and mushroom in anything.

Entrees:
- Puff Pastry Galletes. Have tried the prosciutto, mozzarella, pesto and tomato galette which is mouth-watering, as well as the - Chicken Pot Pie Gallete. Chicken pot pie may be one of my favorite things in the world, and this definitely hits the spot.
They also have savory crepes, a pasta, and meat and fish dishes.


Sandwiches:
- Ibiza Sangria Chicken. Friend ordered this, but the waitress was a little frazzled it seemed, so we ended up getting the sangria salad instead. Problem was corrected pretty quickly. Maybe she was new. Anyway, sandwich looked good (roast chicken with apples, grapes, goat cheese, etc.)
- Eastport Lobster Roll. Lobster and seafood salad, roast corn and other veggies. Clean flavors, very refreshing
- Parmesan Caesar Turkey Pita - basically a caesar salad with roast turkey and tomato, stuffed in a pita. Pretty good, but the turkey was just a tad salty for my tastes.

Oh yeah, love their cookies too. They have some and other simple stuff at the honor bar, so you just take and pay in a jar. See how much they trust you? :D Even then, the staff have given me free cookies here and there while waiting or when we got a wrong order once.

Anyway, you can see I've tried a good sampling of their menu, but there are like 10 other entrees, about 20 sandwiches, and a handful of other appetizers and salads, not to mention an entire breakfast menu, plus more cocktails, coffees, italian sodas, and smoothies. Maybe their tactic is to get someone like me to come in and eventually try everything on the menu. So far it's working :P",2007-10-02,Phoenix,-112.07361599999999,33.477031,"['Nightlife', 'American (New)', 'Wine Bars', 'Bars', 'Restaurants']"
3,Crooked River BBQ + Beer,"What a huge disappointment from what the original used to be as Old Carolina BBQ.

Come to find out the original franchisee left the owner and started his own in the exact same location,  exact same equipment, same recipes. Got sued, lost the battle and now uses his own poor substitute  recipes.

The pulled pork was dry yet had large chunks of fat cap that should have been removed before it was shredded. ( we bought two pounds of pulled pork to go. ) These pieces of fat cap were almost the size of the palm of your hand. The BBQ sauces are very poor imitations of the original company's sauce. They have some really weird ideas about a cherry barbecue sauce and the mustard sauce is not nearly as good as the original.

Was looking forward to their Apple coleslaw but it too was a far cry from what we expected. the only bright spot was the super yummy cornbread, it was my favorite but my wife thought it was way too oily didn't like it at all.

5,Aureole,"Wanted to do a big fancy dinner in Vegas w my gf and ended up choosing this one because it came up in my restaurant.com $50 coupon search. Then I checked Yelp and the reviews were great.

For those interested we decided to go ala carte (didn't particularly like the choices on the fixed menus they were running) and here's a rundown of items: Appetizer: ahi tuna and king crab: was delicious and paired well w a sweet white wine recommended by our sommelier. Entrees: NY strip. well-prepared, great sauce, generous size. Sea scallops: agree w earlier postings that these were excellent. Electronic wine list was (as posted already) very confusing to navigate. We took the recommendations from the sommelier after we had made our food choices and ordered glasses. Everything was excellent and well paired w the foods.

3,Popo's Mexican Food,"I hate to say it, but my recent 5 star review is coming down.  Why?  Well,  something bad is going on at Popo's.  On our last two visits we were underwhelmed with the service and the very last time we went (only 3 days ago) the food was sub-par as well.  We know they are in the process of opening a second location and hope that this sudden decline in awesomeness is due to that situation.  Don't know, but until things improve, I'm gonna not drive out of my way to visit.  Such a pity, as this place had amazing Sonoran style Mexican food.  My favorite thing on the menu was their incredible authentic rice which was undercooked and just plain not good on Friday night.  My next favorite thing is their salsa which tasted fine but was not properly prepared (huge chunks of uncleaned peppers and big pieces of cilantro) so it was off putting.  

Oh, please, will the Mexican Food Gods of Phoenix not let Popo's suffer the same failures as so many of their sister/brother mexican/american restaurants have suffered?  Seems like once they expand, the thing that made them so fantastic in the first place is lost forever.

The server was friendly, but she didn't know the different beer options and didn't seem familiar with the menu. Their uniforms also looked a bit sloppy. And when I said I wanted both ranch and blue cheese for the dipping sauces, I got one sauce cup with both ranch and blue cheese in it. (Is that a thing? I've never had that happen elsewhere before.) I was pleasantly surprised with the food as it was far better than the one other Hooters location I went to years ago. FAR better. I now think of Hooters very differently. The wing sauces are actually hot and spicy. The breaded wings (which were a complete icky, inedible disaster the one time I went to a different Hooters) were cooked perfectly. They had a good crunch and were well-coated in the sauce. Tip: The spicy garlic sauce is a real winner. The Daytona wings were good (unbreaded and grilled), but the sauce was too mild and BBQ-ish for me. The fries were cooked perfectly. The cheese sauce was good. The ranch and blue cheese dipping sauces left something to be desired, but weren't terrible. The original (breaded) wings and fries were a big hit - and they earn this place 4 stars. Plus, we were checked on frequently by both our server and a manager-type. So all in all, I'm kind of a fan of Hooters now.

If I could give this zero stars I would because it is a sad excuse for a restaurant. They were out of cream cheese at 8AM, but they had butter and jelly which you had to put on your own bagel. That would have been fine had they not charged me for the cream cheese anyway (even though I questioned it). The cashier was super curt with us despite there being nobody else in the line. 

They ""toasted"" my bagel in a panini press, which squished it down flat and made it taste like sliced bread. I also ordered coffee, which was below average. The worst part was probably that the lid to the cup was super flimsy (clear plastic that bent every time the cup changed shape, so that when I went to pick up the cup, coffee spilled all over my hands (and I couldn't put the lid on tighter or readjust it).

1,Bazaar Meat by José Andrés,"We made reservations for dinner around 7pm for 2 people (my husband and I). The place was busy but not full. At first glance we were loving the open kitchen and different stations set ups. That was until they took us to the very back station, the only one that is closed off, and sat us at a big table for just the two of us. We were the only ones in the room, at a big table in the middle of the room, we just felt awkward. 

Our server was very knowledgeable and friendly but she seemed to have been busy outside of the seafood room that we were located in. We sat for a long time with nothing on our table and the flow of food was off and weird. We were told that the food would come out as it was ready and then the cold Brussels were one of the last things that we were served. Even the table next to us ( that got sat after us) complained about not receiving any of their dishes. 

We ordered 8 ""shared"" items. Some items were only a bite, some were to ""share"" and then the steaks were huge. This concept was weird for us. The 8 items we ordered plus two dessert ""bites"" and a coffee our bill was $170! If we would've ordered a steak 20oz plus would've been over $120. We completely understand sharing and the idea of that is great but maybe this restaurant isn't for 2 people but maybe geared for larger parties. 

We started with the cotton candy foie gras, that was fun and unique. The Ruben was probably our favorite thing, full of flavor and different. We did have to order two of rubens just so we could both try it. The sloppy joes were anything to brag about. The Asian tacos aren't worth your time, the iberico was improperly sliced and was placed on top of just a slice of nori. The blood sausage with uni was under seasoned, this dish you were given 5 bites. As I mentioned before the placement of the dishes were strange, out last two courses were the corn and Brussels we ordered. The Brussels were cold and didn't have enough acid in them. $15 for a bowl of cold Brussels, no thanks. The last dish we received was the corn, a take on Mexican corn. The flavor was there but I could've used a lime or some salt to add to it. 

Dessert was brought out on a serving platter and you got to pick what you wanted which was different and fun. We were celebrating my husbands birthday so our server brought out an extra dessert for him Which was very thoughtful. 

Overall we were disappointed, maybe we should've gotten the suckling pig because that is their featured item. We like to go out to eat and order a lot of things to share and try new things. Not a spot for that without spending a lot. 

If we were to come back it would be to get the ""Vaca vieja"" with the hopes that we could sit in the actual dining room and enjoy that ambiance.",2016-11-17,Las Vegas,-115.15787479999999,36.1427564,"['Steakhouses', 'Spanish', 'Restaurants', 'Tapas/Small Plates']"

I've always been hesitant to going to Smash Burger cause I always heard ""Oh expensive"" haha what!? Not even expensive.  Dumb non-yelpers haha jk.  I could have been eating smash burger for the 100th time not just 2nd. Oops I just saw a few yelpers say it's expensive, they're cool.  I think they're still kind of cheap for a good burger but yes a little expensive for a chain burger place especially if you throw in the add ons that aren't free.  When you go to Smash Burger do yourself a favor and just get the Sin City Smash Burger which already has a fried egg, bacon, American cheese, grilled onions, haystack onion and the smash sauce and play around with the free add ons.  I liked mine with the spicy mayo and jalapenos.  You don't always have to build your own burger that's when it gets pricey.  The fries are real good too. In and Out is good but I like Smash Burger (burgers and fries) more. 

I heard they use to offer those punch cards for frequently eating there but nope not anymore but they do serve cheap beer. I'm not a fan of the service and that they don't have a drive thru.",2013-02-23,Las Vegas,-115.1377851,36.103679299999996,"['Burgers', 'Restaurants']"

That being said, the service is fantastic and the food superb.  I had the fish tacos, which were probably some of the best fish tacos that I have ever had.  The appetizers we had were the short rib sliders and the coconut shrimp.  Both were delicious.  We topped our meal off with butterscotch pudding and pina colada cake. The pudding was really good, but the cake seemed a little bland.  They also had live music playing, which was great.

We asked to sit at the sushi bar. They told us we needed to order through the servers. Really? The whole point of sitting at the bar is to interact with the sushi chef, all of whom were too young to be sushi chefs. 

The food was even worse than expected. The exorbitant prices they charge and the quality of fish are mismatched.  We ordered the sashimi special and sushi special. Maguro was treated with food coloring. Basically I'll save you the details. It's department store sushi served at the worst Las Vegas strip prices.

He didn't have all of the tables' meals on his cart and had to go back for part of an order after the whole meal was cooked and the person said don't I get scallops?

Service wasn't as good that night, our waitress had a tendency of going MIA, and the food took a long while to arrive given that we were only ordering sushi. In fact I didn't even see the sushi guys in front of us making them, so I'm not sure where they came from.
As many have mentioned, this is not a cheap place to eat. However, I do give them credit. The nigiri pieces were fresh, of good size and not too much rice.

 - Sandwich suffered a bit from having everything on one side of the sandwich leaving me      with bites of just beef/horsey sauce

I called the place around 12:30 on a  Saturday (used the yelp app) and asked if we could have a reservation for eight at 4:30. Was told yes and the woman who answered the phone asked for my name. Good so we are set then. Wrong!

We get there around 4:20 and I let them know I have a reservation and give the hostess my name. She gives me a confused look and says they don't take reservations! Well, who did I speak to four hours earlier?!? She tells me they have to put tables together so we have to wait fifteen minutes. Okay. While waiting there was another party in the same boat, thought they had a reservation but don't. Very organized this place.

We get seated, server comes to take our drink order, all well and good. She comes back and spills water down my wife's back. An accident and she was very apologetic. We give our orders and the food arrives. I had the renegade sirloin medium well with mashed potatoes. The steak was okay, I have had both better and worse at chain steakhouses. The mashed potatoes were excellent. Very buttery but the portion was on the smaller side especially for the price. My Dad got  some sort of chicken meal that I cannot recall and he mentioned it was bland. My Mother liked her baby back ribs. My wife had the crusted Parmesan chicken and found it tasty and juicy.

The manager showed up in the middle do dinner and apologized to my wife for the water spilling. No comped dinner for her or maybe even a desert, nope, sorry for the water spilled down your back at the beginning of dinner, but enjoy! Our server seemed saddled with too many tables and didn't check on out table too often. When she gave us the check, it was for the wrong table and it took awhile to get us the correct check. 

The reservation issue stilled bothered me so as we were leaving, I opened my yelp app and it was still on the longhorn site it was earlier. I called the number and, yep, it was the Longhorn we were just at so I didn't just imagine I had actually made reservations there.

Intended to have dinner at the M.  No clue where or what.  In a hoodie, jeans, & Old Navy moccasins, wandered into Anthony's feeling like seafood for dinner.  It's a formal white tablecloth dining atmosphere.  I'm feeling awkward but who's stink-eyeing me?

We ended up with a really cool waiter, Mario.  Timing to get our orders in was a little wait.  But I saw they were juggling a few tables and a few waiters were tending to us all.  Was cool since my new Yelp BFF and I had a chance to catch up on our lives.  Yeah we were ""badged"" by Yelp during this dinner :D

Da Luca Prosecco was a perfect choice since we were having seafood.  Aroma, flavor, sparkling fizz, bottle design, presentation - they poured and refilled for us although it was kept in a tall ice stand tableside.  Told you formal dining.

I had the Pan Seared Blackened Sea Bass.  The sea bass almost reminded me of fresh steamed seasoned king crab legs meat.  If I could spend this kinda money every week, I'd repeat this dinner!  Soooo excellently delicious!  

The sea bass was on a bed of steamed vegetables which I like to call a hot salad.  Something to do with the flavor in the veggies that reminded me of a salad.  Literally took me over an hour to enjoy my plate.  One cuz I am a slow eater; two cuz it deserved to be savoured.  Fish eaters, I highly recommend the sea bass.

Beautiful modern decor.  Glass wall cases surrounding the restaurant filled with wine bottles.  Where we sat, we were able to view the kitchen through a window wall.  It's really nice!

2,Pepin,"News Flash!  Pepins is a far cry from traditional Spanish cuisine and somehow, someone thought that they would classify it as ""Basque Cuisine"" also.  I guess it sounds good to throw that in.  Me thinks not!  The cuisine has nothing to do with Basque cuisine.  The Spanish cuisine is very much Americanized.  Since most people on this planet have not traveled to Pais Basco (Basque Country, located in the most northern, central region of Spain and partly in France) the owners of Pepins must think that the consumer will take their word for it.  Pepins food is not ""terrible"", but it's not Spanish, and it's definitely not Basque!  The service was atrocious when we went.  The Paella, was hardly a paella.  The garlic shrimp was pretty good though.  And what's up with the Salsa dancing in a ""Spanish"" restaurant.  Weird.

i'm giving it an extra star because I'm nice guy.  If I told actually thought, Yelp would have to come up with a separate rating scale.",2010-12-06,Scottsdale,-111.923057,33.492532000000004,"['Basque', 'Restaurants', 'Spanish']"

I also ordered the warm sea food salad. Such good quality in food, and service was great as well. The calamari was charred but in a good way, where it went well with the arugala.

5,Roy's Restaurant,"We hosted dad's 70th birthday party here a few years ago for around 20 guests.

Before the actual date, I exchanged emails with the group sales manager, who was very cooperative and accommodating when it came to choosing the right pre fixe menu, room, etc. He was even there in attendance at the actual event to make sure everything was running smoothly. The private banquet room was very polished looking with individual lighting, music controls and private doors - the room even had a 60"" presentation screen so that we could play PowerPoint slides celebrating dad's life achievements. The menus even had a personalized birthday logo/message for dad - these soft personal touches really carried far!!

Seeing as how our guests were 95% Korean and of the conservative older generation, I was slightly worried that they may not like the non-traditional Hawaiian cuisine; however, they all raved and loved the Asian inspired dishes and said they fit their palates perfectly. If you are thinking of hosting a private party in Las Vegas, I highly recommend Roy's!!",2015-10-11,Las Vegas,-115.14973549999999,36.11511815,"['Seafood', 'Hawaiian', 'Restaurants', 'Steakhouses', 'Asian Fusion']"

If you look at the photos that have been posted previously you would see it too, except when you see in person it's much more black.

4,Salad King Restaurant,"Wonderful Thai place that is becoming quite popular around town

Salad King is a pretty big place that doesn't seem to be empty ever. The restaurant itself has seating along the windows, but also offers cafeteria style benches for those looking to cozy up in this winter weather and grab some good food. The restaurant serves up neo-Thai dishes and offers a spice chart that borders on the insane. (It can get pretty spicy).

Our party ordered the Pattaya Chicken, Combination Spicy, and something called Islamic Noodles, which is not found on the menu so I guess it's a hidden item. Also ordered an appetizer of miniature shrimp rolls because we just aren't quite fat enough. 

The Mini Shrimp Rolls weren't good. They were not bad, as they are tiny shrimps deep fried in spring roll (wheat) batter. The shrimp were miniature, as advertised, but I was hoping for something tastier or more of them. Ten or so pieces of shrimp scattered across a plate, so I would probably avoid getting it again.

However, the entrees were incredible. The Pattaya Chicken was fantastic. Lightly fried chicken breast pieces tossed with thyme, onion, bell peppers, carrots, honey, and lime chili sauce. The chicken was airfully crisp and the flavors from the vegetables blended well. The aroma was citrusy, but the flavors were a bit sweet and spicy from the honey and veggies. This was my dish and, though I shared it this time, my friends won't be so lucky next time.

The Combination Spicy is a dish comprising of chicken, squid, and shrimp tossed with veggies and lemongrass chili sauce. The dish was a tad spicy (2 chilis on the spice scale), but the flavor was not overpowered by the spice. The meats were a bit small but at least there was a good helping of it. 

The Islamic Noodles was a dish combining pork and chicken atop pad thai noodles and a coconut curry sauce. The dish itself was unbelievably good and I thought it had a kick to it as well. What surprised me about this dish was that I was expecting sweet but it was not noticeably bad at all. The dish kicks you in the mouth with flavor. Words aren't really enough, just order the damn thing.

I will make my way back here again soon. I loved that none of the entrees were over $10 and they were delicious and filling (all dishes come with a side of rice). The service was stellar and the environment was perfect for a nice night out. Really close to the Eaton Centre and Ryerson also so this place is definitely not a secret (though the Islamic Noodles are)...",2012-12-27,Toronto,-79.3814998,43.657697600000006,"['Restaurants', 'Thai']"

They have fries, which I like because even though this is a pasta shop, I like that they have Classic American sides. They also have good prices, so I think that you get a good bang for your buck. 
I have read reviews on here that the staff is somewhat Rude, and I will vogue for that and say that everybody is right. I always get it to go tho, so the rudeness does not bother me because Oftentimes when I am in AZ I am alone so I just go back to my house. 
The exterior of the place is sort of shabby or being in a very high end part of town, but don't let that fool you! This place does have good food. I wish I was in AZ now to be eating it.

Had to get some of the wings of course. They use fresh wings and never frozen which makes a big deference that you can taste. They get them straight from the chicken farms and avoid the middle man. Nice large wings that take more than a few bites to finish. Ordered them with Honey BBQ sauce with some hot sauce on the side for a little extra kick. I thought they were most excellent. Also ordered a West Coast style Philly which is like the standard Philly but with lettuce, tomatoes and a little mayo. Not bad at all.

4,Fishman Lobster Clubhouse Restaurant,"This is our go-to restaurant for big lobster.  We love the lobster mountain here.  Fisherman Club only serves live seafood, no matter which set menu and which size of the lobster that you order.  The waiter will bring the moving lobster to you for approval prior to cooking it.  They can cook a lobster in many ways, but they charge a fee if you request the spicy stir fried style (unless the set menu already calls for this style).  The steamed sea bass included the 3-4 people set menu is about 1 lb and is small for 3-4 people.  

I like the big lobster here over the one at Omei, because the lobster here can be as small as 4 lb.  This is a more reasonable size for a small family dinner.  

Just a note that Fisherman carries lobster from slightly over 1 lb to over 9 lbs.  If the set menu calls for a certain size lobster, and they show you a bigger lobster and you agree to it, they will charge you for the extra weight at $17/lb.  If you don't like the bigger lobster they bring out, you should ask them to get another one; you just have to specify the weight you prefer.  More often, you will end up with a lobster slightly bigger than the weight as specified in the menu, though.

Cash only.  Reservation is highly recommended even for weekdays.",2013-03-12,Toronto,-79.3007954253,43.8242335814,"['Seafood', 'Restaurants', 'Chinese', 'Live/Raw Food']"

3,Ellis Island Cafe,"I was not overly impressed with this place to be honest. We were asking around for some good places to eat from some fellow vacationers and someone told us about Ellis Island. We decided that we would give it a try, due to how highly this tourist talked of it. 
This place had a couple of good things about it but overall I don't think I will be going back. 

First of all it's really loud because it's in the middle of a casino and karaoke goes on right next door, so if you're looking for an intimate place to take someone, this is not your place. I know it's Vegas and there are casinos everywhere but I feel like this place would have more success if it was a secluded restaurant. 

We ordered calamari for an appetizer and then I decided I would go with the spaghetti with sausage. It had a fancier name on the menu but that's what it was. I WAS NOT impressed at all with the spaghetti at all. The noodles weren't cooked very well and the sauce tasted like it was justo poured out of a can. The only thing that got me through it was the sausage and even that wasn't very good. I would honestly give the food a 2 star. 2 because I saw some other meals that were there and they looked decent. The hand brewed Rootbeer is amazing if you stop by here though. 

What made me give that extra star for this place was our waiter. This guy was pretty awesome. He was personal, he did a great job and incredibly helpful when we were all ordering. I really appreciate that in a higher end restaurant. 

Overall you won't find me back here because there are so many places that are better right around town.

4,Vince Neil's Tatuado EAT DRINK PARTY,"One of the only places open for a late lunch at Circus Circus, as the buffet closes at 2pm and the pizzeria's line is very long.  The food offerings are generally American - burgers, salads, sandwiches, and there are a few Mexican options (tacos and burritos).  I had the shrimp tacos and I recommend it.  A tad spicy, as there are pieces of jalapenos or peppers hiding under the cabbage and salsa.  There is a fair amount of shrimp in each taco, not just two pieces.  The sauce is zesty, so additional sauce isn't necessary. You get three in an order.  I also tried some of my bf's avocado cheeseburger - juicy and huge.  Those fries are something else!  I'm not sure what it is, but the coating, shape and crunch are not like typical French fries (they kind of remind me of churros - they are dark and shaped more round with sharp edges than square).

This place is loud, with TVs playing music videos from the past, which is kind of neat (you don't see 80's or 90's music videos at restaurants many places nowadays) and nostalgic.  Decor here is Motley Crue instruments, awards and wardrobes, so that's the theme - hair/rock bands.  It looks like there is a stage in the center of the restaurant, so I assume a band or DJ plays/spins on weekend evenings.  Staff is friendly and quick to seat you.  Food is ready fairly quickly and our server, Windy, was attentive to our table.",2015-04-29,Las Vegas,-115.163310505,36.137112229,"['Breakfast & Brunch', 'Bars', 'Nightlife', 'Restaurants', 'American (Traditional)', 'Food', 'American (New)', 'Beer', 'Wine & Spirits', 'Sports Bars']"

1,Flancer's,"Four of us went here today for lunch.  We've probably been to Flancer's 4-5 times and have always previously thought their food is well above average, and the service was fine to good.  Today, there were multiple issues.  The place was fairly busy, but it's quite small, so it should be very manageable for the wait staff.  

The waitress initially greeeted us and went right into ""are you ready to order?"" in 15 seconds.  We had literally just sat down and hadn't looked at the menus yet.  After asking her to give us a minute to decide, she took forever to come back and get the order.  We placed the order and then waited, I'd guess, 35-40 minutes to get the food.  3 of us 4 ordered hot dishes.....they all came to the table cold....I'd guess that they had been sitting out for at least 15 minutes, so there's why it took so long for us to get them.  Clearly, the kitchen had gotten it out in a timely manner, so things broke down after that.

After we sent them back to be re-heated, the waitress' attitude began to deteriorate.  Another waiter came back with the re-heated foods, and all of the sides were mixed up with with the entrees....we had to re-plate all of the meals ourselves.  Not to mention, one of the sides didn't come back at all, so we had to inform him that we were still waiting on a plate of fries.  After that, the waitress never returned to check on us....we had to flag her down to let her know that we were ready for the check (we had been done eating for quite some time) and she gave a look of irritation.  

After another long wait, we got the bill and took it up to the register to pay, as did many of the other guests, because we figured it would be faster than waiting on our waitress to process it.  We were in line with four other groups who wanted to pay, but no one was manning the register.  A waiter finally came up and asked all of the various groups if we were ready to be seated!  After informing him that we all had already eaten and needed to pay, someone manned the register and we finally made our way out.

Total time at the restaurant...mind you we all had easy things like club sandwiches....2 HOURS!  

Not once did I see a manager in the place.....no one was running the place.....

One of the many irritated customers asked to speak to a manager at one point (there were service issues all over the place), so another waiter was sent over to their table.  The customer said ""I asked for a manager"" and the waiter said ""I'm it"".

This ship was sailing without a captain today......and it was sinking fast.  

As we were leaving, I saw our original waitress walking out of the restaurant in a hurry....her body language suggested that she might have been walking out/quit, but I can't be sure.....maybe she was just going to her car to get something, but I don't think so....

The food was good, but with all of these issues, I'm guessing we won't be back for quite some time, if ever.  There are just too many other choices with good service....I hope for their sake this was a one-day issue and not an ongoing problem",2014-04-06,Mesa,-111.719349,33.450123,"['Sandwiches', 'Restaurants', 'Pizza', 'Burgers']"

I told them forget it we'll go some where else. The hostess talked yhe girls into staying with free apitissers and seating on the restaurant patio.  She then disappeared again, my wife's friend happened to know server who then came and sat us.  At this point I'm pretty sure everyone working there was stoned.  We ordered apps and drinks then ordered pizza.  I would like to say the food was good but they forgot to put our pizza in.  Tgey finally brought thr pizza out about the time we were ready to walk out, and they didn't comp the apps which is the only reason we stayed.  I will never go there again.

Is between bad and mediocre depending on what you get. I disliked having a whole flop of grease on the grand slam skillet and how the ingredients seemed disproportionate. Too much egg, too much cheese, too little potato, barely any existent sausage, tasteless bell peppers, and tasteless mushrooms.
Ungh.

Was great as our waiter was very energetic and cheery.

2,Carnevino,"My first Batali/Bastianich experience and unfortunately it'll probably be my last. There's very little good I could find in my experience at Carnevino. First, the service was horrendous. After ordering a bottle of wine, the waiter poured us a glass, then took the bottle away from the table where we were left waiting 20-25 minutes for someone to bring it back to fill up an empty glass. We also had to ask for a basket of bread after realizing all the other tables except ours received one upon arriving. 

Food:

Tagliatelle with Porcini Trifolati: Sauce was decent, pasta was overcooked. In a restaurant that's owned by these 2? Weird.

Grilled Sweetbreads: Saved this place from getting 1 star. This dish was awesome. If you find yourself here and you like sweetbreads I'd highly recommend them. 

16 oz New York Strip:  Four people at our table ordered it medium rare and they all came cooked a different way. Truly surprising and really unacceptable. One of the steaks felt and tasted like it had been sitting for at least 30 minutes. When we brought the inedible steak up to the waiter he didn't even blink when telling us we wouldn't be charged for it. The impression I got was that it happens all the time.

In a place like Vegas where every world-class chef has at least one restaurant I would absolutely go somewhere else. I guess you could chalk my story up to ""a bad night"" but it really was dreadful. I expected better from Batali and Bastianich.",2013-08-15,Las Vegas,-115.168415,36.124582000000004,"['Bars', 'Restaurants', 'Wine Bars', 'Steakhouses', 'Nightlife', 'Italian']"
2,Firefly Tapas Kitchen and Bar,"Having been to the Firefly on Paradise a month and a half ago, I was really excited to find that there were other locations in the valley not quite so crowded and busy. So, we made a reservation to celebrate our anniversary tonight, and unfortunately, this location was a real bummer compared to the other one.

Wish I'd noticed that a bunch of the reviews on this location appear to be for the Paradise location, not the Anthem location BEFORE we made a reservation. If you're reviewing here, people, this is the Anthem location we're talking about! :)

We started with the baked tetilla and smoked salmon toasts. The tetilla itself was great, but there was a large quantity of cheese and we only got four small, thin pieces of bread to dip in the cheese. They were also served in the cheese, so all were half-soggy by the time we got them. We made up for the rest by using the bread plate. We had almost finished by the time the waiter returned to ask if we needed more bread.

I had really enjoyed the smoked salmon toasts at the other location, and was so bummed to pick up my first one and find that it was burned black and so dry it was broken in half. One other was this way also (black and broken), and the other two were quite dark but at least they weren't broken. Really dry, though, and I lost out on any flavor that might have been on them. The salmon was tasty and the cream was nice as well, though.

We tried the Firefly fish with panko and spicy tartar sauce next, and were surprised by how stinky the fish was. I also live inland--even further inland than Nevada, in fact--and I've always found tilapia to be light on the aroma and to typically smell like the sea. Our tilapia was just plain stinky. Very fishy, very strong. Neither Husband nor I finished our fish.

The mango BBQ ribs were so tender the bones fell out of the meat, and the sauce was good, but we were pretty disenchanted by this point and decided to move on to dessert.

Bummer news--dessert wasn't up to snuff either. I'd gotten the dessert platter at the Paradise location and enjoyed everything on it, but we just wanted a bit of dessert, so Husband picked the lemon berry tarts. I knew they'd be tiny-tiny, having had the ones at the other location, but I was downright disappointed when I discovered the tiny tart shells were barely 1/3 full. And, if you've eaten there, you know that means there's probably between 1/2 tsp. and 1 tsp. of filling. The shells only fit about a tablespoon. The lemon filling was absolutely indistinguishable due to the higher proportion of tart crust and fresh berries (which were very sweet and tasty, thank heaven, or the dessert would have been absolutely irredeemable).

Service wasn't nearly as good as at the Paradise location, where I felt the waiter worked for my tip and I rewarded him handsomely in return. Here, where they were probably half to a third as busy, our waiter showed up at strange times and there were big lags between one course and the next. He was a perfectly adequate waiter but I knew I could expect better from this restaurant group. Our back waiter and runner were actually better than the waiter himself. They were quick, attentive, and helpful, and worked our table wonderfully.

So, a $55 meal I didn't enjoy all that much, but at least my belly is full. If you want the real Firefly experience, please go to the Paradise location. It's worth the wait AND the noise--and this is coming from someone who prefers a more serene dining experience, typically. Oh well.

We told multiple bartenders who clearly did not care, as when we were leaving there was a HUGE puddle inside, which was a hazard for guests who were unaware.  Unfortunately, we were all TOO aware as my date and I were sporadically rained on the entire time we were there.  We actually considered popping open our umbrella, but didn't want to cause (too much of) a scene.

The buffet was adequate and stock with traditional Indian dishes. Chicken Tikka, pakoras, lentils, chickpeas, rice, curry of sorts..  etc. 

I ate rice, the red chicken, some ckickpeas, some eggplant, zucchini, pakoras, naan. The rice was basmati and a little dry. The red chicken was good, chickpeas a little sandy, the eggplant/lentils was good...the chicken tikka was a little dry even in all that sauce. The naan was garlic and good. I ate all my food and although being in good old Gilbert/Mesa Az, felt as though this was authentic and close to what I consider Northern Indian maybe even punjab style.

5,The Goodwich,"As a newbie to Vegas, one thing that has frustrated me to no end is the distinct lack of great, creative, local sandwich shops. Sandwiches are few and far between. But now...rejoice! This tiny little stand has arrived and clearly takes the title for best sandwich shop in Vegas.

Good sandwich shops usually pride themselves on bigger, larger more monstrous sandwiches with endless meat combinations. Not this one. These sandwiches are well portioned, affordable and will only set you back a few bucks. Even the simple $3 sandwiches (like the fried egg) are glorious, but as you go up the menu, the quality and creativity only grow, and even the most expensive sandwiches are only $9 (for sandwiches with Foie Gras or Truffles!).

4,Lao Sze Chuan,Heard about this fairly new place from a local Vegas website and stopped in by myself one night for some quick dinner and went with the Three Chilli Chicken which was really good with white rice..nice kick to it  I didn't really sample much more here just had a few drinks at the bar but all around it was a nice place. Service was spot on and very friendly. Decor inside was relaxing and comforting. I'd return and try a few more things a 2nd time around to give it a thorough review but for now I'm a fan.,2015-04-23,Las Vegas,-115.19568400000001,36.114539,"['Chinese', 'Asian Fusion', 'Szechuan', 'Restaurants']"

Rating off those 3 factors alone,  I'd give it 5 stars. However, when I'm about to drop $150+ on dinner for two, I'm looking for the food to be equally high in quality and presentation. We ordered the ""lobster 2 ways"" appetizer, general chicken, and seafood fried rice (with alcoholic drinks). I'm disappointed to report that the food itself simply lacked flavor and quality. My husband and I agreed that we've both had better tasting Chinese food from strip malls. I must stress that the food wasn't BAD, it just didn't ""wow"" us- and in Vegas, there's no reason why you shouldn't be walking away from a meal of that price feeling ""wowed"".

5,Don Jose Mexican Food,"I have been coming to this restaurant for over 35 years (except for the brief shut down).  It was a family owned restaurant, and they were wonderful. It was reopened  and  they have increased the menu to include chicken and a few other things, while still retaining the family recipes. I love their food, and as to the few bad reviews here- I would disregard them. I love the hot sauce-it is not salsa with tomatoes and onions and chunks- that is fine with me -I love the flavor- calling it bland is BS- it has wonderful flavor just no chunks. It is not watered down.  Their tacos, beans and enchiladas are the best I have ever had at ANY restaurant. I don't like chipotle or a smoky chile flavor. They fry the taco with the meat in it, and I prefer that to  slopping juicy meat in a fried shell and having the bottom of the shell dissolve on your first bite. The enchiladas are not made with that yucky dark reddish brown sauce that is at most restaurants- that only taste of chile nothing else. these have a lot of flavor, and the comment about them using a non dairy cheese was just an out and out lie- Cheese MELTS, and they are wonderful! My whole family loves it- extended family as well. So take the word of someone who has eaten a lot of Mexican food- I am 56 years old and I have lived here my whole life- I am not a transplant from somewhere else- who has no clue what real Mexican food tastes like. If you like black beans or shrimp and seafood Mexican then this is not the restaurant for you- it is Sonoran- which is my favorite!! I do think you should have free refills on chips, but they are very generous with their refills on  beverages. As far as service goes- they are right on everything- I do figure if the restaurant is completely full that you might be a little more patient- or come back when they are not quite so busy. It is a small place, so not a lot of maneuvering room. I think they are all great",2013-06-05,Phoenix,-112.0006929,33.4807458,"['Restaurants', 'Mexican']"

my dish was ok. standard mex but very salty. i won't count our dinner companion because she is too picky (everything was wrong with her dish according to her). however, my girlfriend loved her fish with lettuce wrap dish...said it was ""the bomb"", a phrase she has rarely used since entering her mid 30's! our prickly pear margaritas were quite tasty though, so a grand 4 stars for that.

but what made me give it only 2 stars was the service...we never, ever expect much because we know how hard it is to be a server...however, with us as the only customers, the service tonight was way off. overall, 50 bucks for 3 entrees, 2 margaritas and 2 beers.",2009-12-13,Tempe,-111.95176070000001,33.4229035,"['Restaurants', 'Mexican']"
3,Acacia Cafe,"This place is real small so I have never tried it, but I was going with a friend who likes it. I noticed a small patio and with the perfect weather I was enthused! You have to order at the counter then they bring the food to you.  Drinks are self serve. I had a coupon for buy one entree, get one 50% off, even with that I paid $16.61 for an omelet, french toast, an iced tea and a small orange juice! It was basic food, so I felt this was expensive, without coupon it would have been at least $20 and this is counter ordering. I can pay this much and have the same quality and table service. I guess that is why Snooze had a wait, so we went here.

I had an omelet with chees, added ham and green peppers.  The peppers were totally raw, they would be MUCH better cooked or at least hot, not added at the end and the omelet folded over. I asked for fruit with it, which was old! The melon was translucent and I didn't touch it! My friend ordered the French Toast and crisp bacon. The bacon was crisp, not greasy and good. The French Toast did have cinnamon but was a typical slice, nothing extrodinary.  They said it came with real maple syrup,  but it comes in a place ice cup, like the jams, so you have no label to see what you are eating.  The juice is touted as being fresh squeezed, but not what you would think, to me that means they squeeze it, then serve it! When I asked further I was told it is squeezed at a company in Tempe, that makes it local-good, but WHEN was it squeezed??

I don't stray from the pho menu. I've tried the beef and also the pork with rice and egg noodles and they are all fantastic!

I have come twice for lunch and really enjoyed the Chicken and Peanut Pad Thai with a whole chicken breast on top. It is really delicious. I was told they had experimented with a super spicy sauce for a while, but they are now back to their regular and manageable level of flavorful sauce, which is perfect for me. 

I would come here to work from 'home', sitting at a table with my computer (although I don't believe they have internet) or sitting on the sofas by the door for reading/editing work.

I have also been twice for drinks. The cocktails are a bit pricey but often worth it since they are done so well and have a great (and long!) cocktail menu. The Peach Daisy was delicious and the Piña Colada was fantastic (unlike many bad imitations that you find in the UK).

They are also very fast. My whole family had food in front of us in about 3 minutes. It's definitely not the best place to go if you are looking to sit down for a long lunch, because there are very few seats in the place, and not much standing room.

1,Mastro's City Hall,"I really do not like to write bad reviews, however, If there was a bad review I have been waiting to write it was this one...  If anyone has read any of my other reviews it is easy to see I eat at a lot of places all over the country.  I have been to some really high end/expensive establishments.  I have to say that this has to be the most unreasonably over priced steak house I have ever been to.  We walked and and were seated at our reservation time.  They were probably 75% full when we arrived.  We sat at our table 5-10 minutes before the first person came to our table.  It was another 5-10 minutes before we received water and bread that we did not even want.  As we were waiting for our water, we did open the menu and we were quite entertained with the $3200.00 bottles of wine, $300+ appetizers, $100.00 steaks.  I get it, It is a high end establishment, but if you are commanding premium prices, then you ought to be providing 100% premium services and food.  So on to that part, the food...  I ordered chicken which was so OVER salted, I only ate one piece of it...  My wife ordered Halibut which was so dry that it was almost like rubber.  Our friends ordered steaks  (Filet), of which I tried and found them to be sour in taste.  The only thing this visit had that warrants a star rating, is the crab cake appetizer, $32.00 mind you, and the sweet potato fries, $10.00...  So, if you are looking to visit an establishment where you can flaunt your disposable income, or your looking to meet someone who is flaunting, this is your spot.  If you are looking for good food, and good service I would strongly recommend you try another spot.  

The manager did follow up with a call to see how our service was, and upon learning of our opinion on the visit, he offered us a bottle of wine, which we dont really drink.  When we told him we were not interested in wine, he said he would take $100.00 off of our next visit.  Given that we are out of town, that was of no value, and even if we were gong to be around longer, I would not go spend another $300.00 to get $100.00 off.

$$$$ of in Yelp talk ~$61 per person does not describe what you can expect to pay per person here.  That will be just for your main entree item (singular), no side, no drink, no appetizer, no sweets.. Oh, you will get bread...

After reading other reviews, I knew better than to accept their ""offer"" of chips and guacamole.  I think it's strange that they would charge people for that when it's not even listed on the menu as an option.  Also, when they brought out chips and salsa prior to our meal, they literally gave us a PLATE that had maybe 6-8 chips on it!  Really??  Thumbs down for that!  I guess if you're not ordering the chips and guac you're just SOL.

However, the food was really good!  I had the verde enchiladas, and the verde sauce was great!  My friend ordered the conchita (sp?) with mole sauce.  She loved it!  We both had the watermelon juice and it was delish and very refreshing.  

They also have a ""check-in"" offer from Yelp, that will get you a free dessert, which we used.  The default dessert must be flan, because that's what she automatically brought out to us.  It was good, but not great.

4,The Sheep Heid Inn,"I have come here several times now, and must say I really like it.

Having lived most of my life in the countryside, going to a cosy pub or cafe was the reward at the end of a long walk. Edinburgh is great at providing instant satisfaction, but sometimes it's nice to go through the ordeal of facing the elements, in exchange for a nice reward. 

Most times I have been to the Sheep Heid Inn, I have really come face to face with the Scottish weather. To get to Duddington, one must walk around the foot of arthur's seat, a passage, a path that is often blasted with gail force winds which feel like continuous slaps across the face, made even more severe by the hail, drizzle, or whatever else Scotland feels like throwing at you. Aside from this, it's a pleasant walk. Arthur's seat is beautiful, and you will see the loch at Duddingston before actually reaching the village.

I advise you to walk a little around the cobblestone streets before entering the pub. There's a cute little church overlooking the loch, which is itself quite a stage to the spectacle of elegant swans. You may think you just stepped into Hogsmeade? Not so far off. Apparently this little village influenced even J.K.Rowling.

The pub prides itself in being the oldest in Scotland. Inside, it does feel a little more modern than one might expect, but it still retains a certain charm. Arriving after a wee walk in the cold is a massive relief. Though the quality of the drinks is great, they are a bit pricier here than elsewhere. I have had some good cider and gin and tonics here over the years, and came here for New Years eve for two years running. There's a skittles alley, a VERY difficult pub quiz, and a area reserved to dining upstairs.

I am yet to try the food, but it looks very good went put out on the plate!",2013-03-20,Edinburgh,-3.1478382999999996,55.94212660000001,"['Restaurants', 'Bars', 'Pubs', 'Gastropubs', 'British', 'Nightlife']"
2,Korean BBQ,"We got lazy and desperate for Korean food.   We initially drove to Fmp for Korean express after reading all the great Yelp reviews.   Alas, they were closed.... 

So we settled for Korean BBQ.   

Pros: we were lazy and it was next to our bbt joint.   

Cons: we asked for extra spice.  Seeing as we are Asian, the Korean owner perhaps thought we couldn't handle it and made it mildly spice.   Even the Kimchi they served as the mini app was spicier. 

I got the Kimchi soup.   It was full of..... Tofu, some Kimchi and some mixed leftover meat pieces.   It was not Spicy, and pretty bland to be honest.   After I finished all I wanted was more water because of all the salt I just finished.  The rice was just regular, not that amazing soft and slightly sticky Korean rice. 

The husband got the Gamjatang.   At least he had adequate protein.   

I know, keep your standards low at a food court.   But for the price we paid $8 for gamjatang and Kimchi soup..... I'm going to complain, just a little.   Thank goodness they didn't serve us with those challenging Korean chopsticks.  

Unsatisfying, Korean food that will need to be washed down with another serving of bbt!",2016-05-18,Markham,-79.3161392212,43.8602771847,"['Korean', 'Restaurants']"

4,Paul's Club,"CROWDED! This place is always crowded on the weekends (a good thing!) but the space is not conducive for huge crowds. I am always pushing my way down the center to find a place where I can hopefully weasel my way towards the bar to grab a drink. 

Regardless of this, I love coming here! It's a great place to meet friends and have a beer. I've been both on the weeknights and weekends. Boyfriend and I come here during the week to sit at the bar and grab a beer. It's a great place to hang out. They have fun, throwback music during the week, and it's oftentimes very easy to get some couch seating. During the weekend, I often come here to meet friends. If you're lucky, you can snag some couch seating, which is oh so fun! Reminds me of having bottle service in Vegas for some reason. It's very cozy and a great place to hang out, talk, and drink. I probably wouldn't end my night here. It's definitely the kind of place to start the night and then head up or down State. 

Good vibes here, too. Love the lighting-- not too dark, not too bright! And the tree-- adore the tree! It gives off such a unique, fun ambiance. Do not believe people who tell you it is real. It's not. ;)

They also have a great tap list of beers I've never heard of, which I love. I am always down to try a new beer, so this is the place to do it. Bartenders are very knowledgable about the taps, so I generally will say that I like Beer X and get a recommendation off that.",2014-03-09,Madison,-89.38833832739999,43.0748794571,"['Restaurants', 'American (New)', 'Nightlife', 'Lounges', 'Bars']"

My father in law ordered the turkey leg and it was tough and didn't have very much flavor (I tried it). He said he had better at a state fair.

5,Tournament of Kings,"Great show. We wanted to take our kids to an interactive place for dinner one evening and decided on the Tournament of Kings. It was so enjoyable. 
They started off with some songs and introductions. The Wizard got people involved and cheering. The show involved jousting, racing and sword fighting. You cheer on your knight as he battles to be the champion.
The food was surprisingly tasty. We didn't obviously go there for the food, but were pleasantly surprised. They started with tomato soup (AKA Dragons Blood) and then brought out the main course. It was a Cornish game hen, some roasted red potatoes and broccoli. It was very good. It was finished with a apple fritter. Service was slow at times.
The show also moved a decent pace and involved lots of special effects including fireworks and fire displays. We really enjoyed the show and would recommend it. We may even come again, if the opportunity arises, it was that good.

4,Laziza,"My dreams came true when Laziza first opened up when I was still living in Kent. My girlfriends and I were frequent visitors and literally came here once a week to gossip and eat their yummy Mediterranean cuisine. They also have a bunch of other options aside from Mediterranean, but I rarely ever go with anything besides the hummus with chicken entree. All entrees come with either a soup or salad, which is nice because a lot of restaurants charge extra if you want either before the actual meal. The chicken was always cooked to perfection and flavored with the perfect amount of spices. Add that to the rice and delicious hummus + veggies and you have yourself one good finger licking meal. 

Since moving to Cleveland and going back to Kent on occasion, I always make a point to return to my old watering hole and place my usual order. Management is always on point, service is good, but this past visit, I noticed my entree was not out of this world like I had remembered (granted it was homecoming weekend and they were super busy) Nonetheless, it was still a great dining experience and I can't wait to go back for the food and for the nostalgia of being a care free college student :)",2014-11-03,Kent,-81.3567400351,41.1528954306,"['Restaurants', 'Mediterranean']"
2,Vida Mexican Kitchen y Cantina,"I went in for brunch here today, I was with a party of 6 including one person who actually works here. That being said, you would think we would have had excellent service and our orders correct.. Instead, terribly slow service, orders incorrect/incomplete. Had my friend not been an employee I would have insisted on asking for a manager. For starters, drinks from the bar took about 10 minutes if not longer to arrive at the table. For a restaurant less than half full, that is too long. As for the food, I asked for no jalapeños on my potatoes. They come out with it and our server quickly notices and offers to bring me another serving of them. She does and now they are without cheese.. Whatever, fine. Next two from our table are missing the bacon from their order, ask for it and the server brings them ONE serving and asks if that's ok.. Really.. Really? Sure, that's fine they would love to share 2 pieces of bacon. Who shares bacon? I believe had a member of the party not been an employee we may have had different treatment, but you would have thought we would have at least gotten a prompt service as well as accurate orders. Shame on the chef, and shame on the server or whoever checks plates at the window for overlooking 3 out of 6 plates.

First off, I have a thing about filling out the stupid fucking check sheets all cheap, shitty sushi bars want you to fill out. NUMBER ONE, THEY HAVE ALL THE NAMES THEY MADE UP OF ALL THE SHIT THEY MAKE BUT NO EXPLANATION OF WHAT THEY ARE! WHAT THE HELL IS A SUNSHINE ROLL ANYWAY? So, I sit down, introduce myself  with a smile and ask the name of the sushi guy. I explain that I'd rather just have him tell me whats fresh and explain what kinds of things I like and would he mind just taking care of if. Simple enough in a empty goddamn sushi bar right? NO!!!! He basically tells me, if you don't fill out my stupid fucking directions, I'm not smart enough to prepare you sushi.

Not wanting to be a complete butt hole and stand up, leave and go to Yasu where they have a clue (a decision I am now regretting) I smile, fill out the sheet and wait for what I expect, the same ol shit you get at every strip mall sushi bar in the country.....

They use a very unique (to me anyway) system for those groups waiting for a table. They will text you when your table is ready; however, saying that, today I got the text 10 minutes after we were seated. Can't explain that one.

They've revamped the enterprise so expect a more upscale experience that remains family friendly. They have new ice cream flavours and new sundae combinations. IMO they seem to have moved their focus away from their infamous waffles/crepes (though they are definitely still on the menu) and focused on their sundae and hot/cold drink option. In the corner of the menu my cousin noticed that they also offer ice cream sandwiches but haven't tried or seen those yet.

On both recent visits, I've created my own two-scoop sundae. Mainly because they offer white chocolate silk ice cream (I have a soft spot for white chocolate) with Nutella, strawberries and dark chocolate sauce. Add the complimentary whip cream and waffle biscuit and you've got a little piece of bliss.

Price point is on the slightly higher side of reasonable (1 scoop is $9, 2 scoops is $10.75 plus tax) but I think it's worth every penny.

Servers are attentive and friendly.

3,Red Kimchi Korean Restaurant,"As a child of Asian immigrant parents who also owned a small business, I feel truly sad to present them with a mediocre review. 

The owner seemed extremely friendly amidst a business that isn't doing so well. 
I would rather this review serve as a wake-up call or maybe inspire a relocation, because I really do want them to do well. 

The decoration of the place seems quite outdated (probably the red plush seats...very 80s) - but it does indeed have a warm Asian household vibe with the murals and Korean music playing in the background. 

As the only patron in the whole establishment during lunch hour, their prices and portions are really generous. This should be a great attraction for nearby ASU, but Papago plaza is filled with vacant storefronts and there's simply no walk-in customers. 

Now if their food was delicious, their location wouldn't be such an issue. It's not- I ordered the Kimchi soondubu and Bulgogi lunch, and both just seemed really off. 

The soondubu was 85% water, and the consistency of the soup threw off the whole dish. Maybe I'm under the impression that it should be a tofu stew and not a tofu soup, but at least the flavors were good. There was no inquiry about spice level, and that makes me wonder if the dish was already pre-made.

The bulgogi had an overwhelming vinegar flavor, and would rank as one of the worst I've ever had at a Korean restaurant. 
I guess I'm also skeptical of how fresh the food can be when I'm the only person here and many of their food items are seafood-based. 

Maybe I just came on an off-day, and hopefully this isn't Dream Cafe (Seinfeld) in Arizona and they start to thrive. I love supporting local businesses but I'm not sure if I'll come back",2015-05-22,Scottsdale,-111.9275459,33.4643735,"['Restaurants', 'Juice Bars & Smoothies', 'Korean', 'Food']"

4,Earl of Sandwich,"The Skinny: 
Awesome sandwich joint open late with a self-proclaimed ""world famous"" tagline that lives up to their hype!

Environment:
This place was in one of the casinos so the environment is... well it's Vegas, what else do you want? They have some tables for seating, and since most people come and go fast, it isn't that hard to find seating.

Service:
Mostly service is consisted of the cashiers and the sandwich makers. There isn't much to say about the customer service for the tabling because that doesn't really matter here.

Food:
Amazing sandwich! I got the hot turkey sandwich because I wanted to try out the cranberry sauce and stuffing since one of my favorite sandwiches is the Bobbie at Capriotti's of Culver City. Man... the sandwich at Earl surpassed my past experiences with that kind of sandwich elsewhere! It was very balanced and did not sog up the bread, but it kept it moist at just the right amount. The balance kept the flavor in without an over dryness of bread. My friends got other hot sandwiches and it seemed everyone liked their sandwiches. Some came by again the next day!

Overall: 4/5
Good place for sandwiches, you should definitely try this place for a small bite when in Vegas.",2014-08-25,Las Vegas,-115.171877,36.109361,"['Restaurants', 'Caterers', 'Event Planning & Services', 'Sandwiches', 'Salad', 'Soup', 'Food', 'Food Delivery Services']"
4,McMullan's Irish Pub,"I've had variations of Irish food in the past but never authentic Irish. A take home with instructions on how to cook corned beef here, a sandwich loaded with corned beef there, and once a Sheppard's pie from a place that specialized in another ethnic variety.

If McMullan is a window on how good Irish food can be then open it up cause i'm gonna jump through it next chance i get.

The Apps!!!
Homemade Crisps
- I had an impression of what they were going to be like as i read the description and envisioned it in my mind. When they came i was sadly disappointed that the Crisps werent made to order, instead of warm salted crisps they were room temperature. Oh well the taste of them totally made up for the fact that they're made in batches and allowed to sit, which in the long run is better for no oil is still on the crisps. I personally enjoyed both sauces. I had a person preference to never eat or try curry from anyone that isnt of asian or south east asian/indian decent due to a bad experience with a ""Country Captain Chicken MRE"" but damn the curry is right on. A lot of friends werent too fond of the Marie Rose sauce, imagine a sweeter thousand island. To me it's a nice contrast from the curry that tastes pretty darn good when dipped lightly.

Sausage Rolls
- Thanks to the internets i've made a few friends in Australia and the UK. I've been to Australia once and was amazed at things like Turkish or Lebanese style Kebabs. My Brit and Aussie mates keep urging me to try Sausage Rolls. No matter who it is or if i just engage a conversation about food with a random Brit or Aussie Sausage Rolls always pop up. 
And now the Sausage Roll! Pretty much a sausage rolled in puff pastry served with a very robust mustard. Wasnt too impressed because the sausage tasted VERY close to Vienna Sausages but the puff pastry and the robust mustard made it all go along.

The Entrees!! 
Aon Do Tri
- A sampler of their main entrees the Aon Do Tri features Diddy's Irish Stew, Corned Beef and Cabbage, and Shepard's Pie. Flanking the three sampler sized bowls are two slices of home made Brown Bread.
- To me the Brown Bread is something unique. When i picked it up it had the weight and feel of a thick slice of pound cake, the texture is very similar to cake with the softness and the moisture, but the taste is all bread. A little butter and dip this into the Diddy stew....oh lawd...
- Diddy's Irish Stew, Dont order this if you dont like lamb. The first bite was gamey and rustic but comforting. I love lamb and this stew just hit the spot with chunky bits of that adorably delicious mammal, potatoes, carrots, a few slices of onions and large celery cuts that just absorbed all the flavors of the stew. Lamb flavored celery...that's gonna make me drool for a while.
- Corned Beef and Cabbage. If i could pinpoint a fault to this it's that the portion size was just too small. Nice meaty hunks of corned beef still in it's cooking liquids swimming with potatoes and cabbage. It just dont get any better then this really.
-Shepard's Pie. I would count this as the odd man out in this triumvirate of Irish signature dishes because of the taste. Maybe it's because i saved it for last, maybe because the mashed potatoes trapped the heat inside and the first bite scorched a few parts of the inside of my mouth. Flavor wise i was just expecting a bit more from this.

- Fish n Chips
WOW, large cuts of flaky cod, very light but crisp breading and what seemed to be a home made tartar sauce with lots of relish flavor. I might just have to start spending Thursday nights here...

- Beef & Guinness Stew
Andy ordered this and i grab a small spoonful when he wasnt looking. Now this is some goooooood stew! You can barely taste the Guinness but cant help to notice the richness of it in the stew. The beef was tender cooked to perfection and absorbed a lot of flavor. Very nice indeed.

4,Zakkushi,"I'm Coming Back!

My dad and I ventured this place last night and I had a terrific time. I wasn't aware that this place existed at all - shame on me.

What did we have? (more like, what didn't we have!)
- Takowasabi (Octopus mixed w/ wasabi stems)
- Kuragé (Jelly Fish w/ imitation shark fin in sesame oil sauce)
- Kushi (Premium Set): Wagyu Beef / Duck Breast / Free Range Chicken Momo /  Premium Beef Tongue
- Lamb Chop
- Unagi (Eel)
- Sashimi Platter
- Chicken Karaagé
- Horenso Ninniku Foil Yaki (king oyster mushrooms, spinach, garlic, wrapped & grilled in foil w/ soy sauce & butter)

My FAVOURITE items have to be:
- Takowasabi (great starter)
- Chicken Karaagé also good to start with 
- Kuragé (one of their new menu items, very similar to a Chinese appetizer )
- Wagyu Beef
- Free Range Chicken Momo
- Premium Beef Tongue

The remainder were good, but i was a little underwhelmed by the Horenso Ninniku Foil Yaki. I was expecting larger pieces of mushroom and/or deeper flavour - neither of which I took away from that dish.

We paired all of this with hot sake and tea to finish.

The atmosphere is quite something. Lots of cheering, yelling across the restaurant, and energy in general.

2,Crabby Joe's Tap & Grill,"A group of my cousins dropped by Crabby Joe's last night at 9 pm and our food didn't come out until 10 pm *subtract a billion stars*. Even the drinks took at least half an hour for it to arrive at our table.

The only good time to go here is after 9 pm because the apps are half off (but you have to buy a drink too). Drinks are $2.89 which is expensive...it's just pop. My sister and I ordered 10 honey and garlic wings, 10 medium wings, and the loaded cheese fries. The wings were dry and the fries were not loaded with cheese. It was loaded more with sour cream instead.

I never go to Crabby Joe's unless my cousins invite me out. Not my kinda place.",2013-02-20,Mississauga,-79.6837002,43.5460321,"['Nightlife', 'Restaurants', 'Canadian (New)', 'American (Traditional)', 'Bars']"

4,Julian Serrano,"I came here for my brother's wedding rehearsal dinner. My parents had agreed upon a set menu that was sent to my parents to review. My father found quite a few spelling mistakes that he corrected and sent back, some of which had not been changed by the time we arrived for dinner the next day. 

We paid for multiple small plates and unlimited sangria. I was beyond shocked that after my first glass of Sangria, when asking for another I was told it was no longer being served. After spending a lot of money on this meal, I was in complete disbelief that he would not give me what we paid for. I didn't make this a big deal because the night wasn't about me, but after telling my father (who had paid for the entire meal), he was upset that we didn't get our full monies worth.

3,Red Square Restaurant & Vodka Lounge,"In SOVIET RUSSIA, Red Square reviews you!  

Went to Red Square (inside the Mandalay Bay hotel and casino) twice over an extended Memorial Day weekend holiday.  The first time was for dinner and moderate drinks:  The food at Red Square is fairly average.  If you are looking for food indicative of the people and their culture, you have come to the wrong place.  The Siberian Nachos (smoked salmon, wasabi cream, and chives on top of a wanton chip--surely a traditional staple of the Gulag) were surprisingly good.  My entree of Strozapretti Stroganoff, however, was far from anything special and, to top it off, came to the table seeming like it had been sitting around for a while.  Orders of caviar come with a full array of traditional condiments--blini and toast points, creme fraiche, crumbled egg whites and egg yolks from a hard boiled egg, chives, and onions.

We returned to Red Square to fully indulge in the restaurant's vodka menu--which is extensive.  We took a pass on paying ""bottle service"" prices to visit the private vodka vault and instead ordered shot after shot after shot after...you get the picture.  Red Square is definitely the place to go if you're looking to try a lot of different vodkas.  2 oz. shots were in the $11 to $30 range (for the high end vodkas).  I'd suggest doing one of the higher end samplers if you're looking to try the pricey stuff.

Service was friendly, and the decor, while Vegas cheesy (featuring a big Communist mural on the wall and a headless statue of Lenin in front of the restaurant) was fun.",2011-06-08,Las Vegas,-115.176156283,36.092788511900004,"['American (New)', 'Cocktail Bars', 'Restaurants', 'Arts & Entertainment', 'Lounges', 'Bars', 'Russian', 'Nightlife', 'American (Traditional)', 'Steakhouses', 'Casinos']"
5,Roaring Fork,"One of our favorite restaurants here in Scottsdale!  They have a nice southwestern take on a lot of dishes that are recognizable, but I appreciate that Roaring Fork puts their own spin on things.  

They offer a lovely bread basket with hot rolls and mini cornbread muffins with soft, whipped butter--a nice way to start of the meal.  We haven't tried a lot of apps but highly recommend their flatbread chicken pizza, which can also work as a meal.  The cheese they use melts so well and creates a really creamy texture paired with moist, rotisserie chicken.  Delicious!  

The Spinach Chicken Waldorf Salad is amazing!  The chicken they use is the spit-roasted chicken, which is juicy and flavorful.  The salad is incredibly large, especially for the price and contents, with a good mix of ingredients, texture, and flavors.

My husband is a fan of the flavors of the ""Big Ass"" burger as well as the Cedar-Planked Salmon.  The Sugar-Cured Duck Breast was cooked perfectly with a nice crispy skin and great flavors between the duck and the accompaniments.  Would also highly recommend the green chili macaroni and cheese; decadent, rich, and luxuriously creamy. 

We had their seasonal pie, pecan, which was warm, rich, and deep in flavor, and they paired it with plenty of ice cream (because nothing cuts sweet like sweet!).",2015-11-18,Scottsdale,-111.927080154,33.508695278000005,"['American (Traditional)', 'Steakhouses', 'Food', 'Restaurants', 'Nightlife', 'Desserts', 'Bars']"

I wish they had put more cheese in the bowl though; there wasn't too much and it was all in one place.

2,Bottiglia Cucina & Enoteca,"Went there very recently, on a Friday night. We set inside, too hot for out. It was around dinner time, and very busy. Issues all over this place! I am having a hard time deciding where to start. 1. Reservations were completely screwed up. 2. Hostess (hostesses) are basically clueless. Gave 90% of the customers to 2 waiters, instead of dividing between 5 of them! Result: frustrated, overworked waiter and slow service. But he was friendly. Acoustics in the restaurant are terrible! Can't hear s**t anyone sitting close to you say. But you do hear constant loud noise from the rest of the diners. Sorta like a few dozen of parakeets screeching... On top of that, there's also a live music band, starts around 7:30 pm?  If you're there with anyone else, just eat, don't expect a conversation, unless you are monologueing, and not expecting an answer. Our waiter said he will lose his voice by the end of the night. Last, not least, the food. I started with their version of Caprese salad appetizer with Heirloom tomatoes and burrata cheese, at $14 it was the best dish there. Shrimp putanesca for main course. That was underwhelming. The sauce was very oily, pasta undercooked (not just al dente), and contained a small number of shrimp, which were overcooked & dried out. My friends were not impressed with any of their dishes either. I would consider giving them another try, just to be fair, but for sure, not on a Friday night!",2016-06-21,Las Vegas,-115.09019280000001,36.020696,"['Bars', 'Nightlife', 'Italian', 'Restaurants', 'Wine Bars']"

1,Pancho's,"I just don't see how this place is going to last.  The prices are just too high for the quality of food provided. The only reason I went was because of the happy hour half off appetizers and discounted drinks.   

The chips were cold and seemed like the type of cheap chips you'd get at a grocery store.   And the salsa was completely uninspiring -- typical boring, tasteless, spiceless garden salsa that could've easily come from a grocery store bottle.  I asked if they had a hotter, habanero type salsa -- and was provided with habanero Tabasco sauce (I like Tabasco sauce, but not exactly what I was looking for)

Tried the naughty maggie Margarita.   Found it to be no more interesting than a standard Margarita. 

My main dish was the queso fundido appetizer (it was just me, so the large appetizer was a full meal).  Well, it looked nothing like what I'm used to seeing with queso fundido at other Mexican restaurants.... looked more like a plate of sour cream. Flavor was okay but not something I would order again. .. and had I paid the usual full $16 price for this appetizer, I would've been very disappointed...instead of just moderately disappointed.  

When the check arrived,  the happy hour discount amount for what I ordered was incorrect so that had to be fixed.  But it actually couldn't be fixed and instead I had to be given an additional dollar off (so double check the pricing for those going for the happy hours deals).  And I was charged the full price on the Margarita because apparently that was not part of the happy hour special discounted drinks (something that was not clearly explained by my waitress when I ordered.... even though I had expressly asked her about the drink specials just before I ordered it -- so she clearly knew where my head was at and allowed me to order the non-discounted drink instead ..... a little bit deceptive if you ask me).  

I'm sorry to say but there is just nothing good to report about this place. I hope the restaurant that takes over this place after they inevitably close does a complete overhaul.   I had high hopes for this place,  but having gotten a small bad taste, there is simply no reason for me to ever come back and try anything else.

If Yelp allowed for zero stars, that would've been my rating.

2,Bento Box,"First impressions. I'm a stickler with sushi so others might not be so picky.

The nori on my spicy tuna roll was tough- too chewy. Rice was not cooked long enough. Slightly too firm. The tuna didn't strike me as fresh. It lacked flavor and was mildly pink. 

Shrimp tempura roll was drenched in sweet syrup. I can understand a little for flavor and design but this roll was just drenched in it.  Yech. 

As far as sushi goes, nothing great. I wasn't hungry anymore when I was done with two rolls but that was my only take away from the meal- just that it took away my hunger- not that it was particularly good. 

MORE annoying was that for a 9 dollar and 70 cent tab my waitress took the 15.00 Cash I gave her and assumed that the extra six bucks was a tip. !!!!!! I was on break at work and the process of getting my change back took WAY too long!!!!   (I sat there waiting for her to realize that I didn't intend to tip her six dollars on a 9 dollar tab.) 

Finally the sushi chef got her attention when she emerged from wherever she had gone. 

I asked for my change and when she brought it back she brought back 30 cents!!! (The ACTUAL change from the 9 dollar and change tab not the rest of the change from the 15 dollars cash.)


Can I have five dollars in ones back so I can tip you twenty percent of the 9 dollars and 70 cent tab NOT tip you 5 dollars on what wasn't even a 10 dollar tab! 

Good lord!

All that made me late back to work. 

I still left her 2 bucks but I won't be back.

Not worth it.

The bad 80's music playing the whole time made it much worse. I mean, ACDC is fine and all, but not blasting at lunch when I'm eating mediocre sushi and waiting for my server to do math. !

I'm sure she was new and will never make that mistake again. Unfortunately neither the service, the food, or the decor was enough to entice me back.",2014-11-20,Phoenix,-112.111433694,33.7112170171,"['Specialty Food', 'Sushi Bars', 'Japanese', 'Food', 'Restaurants']"

1,Porkopolis,"I ordered a three meat take out dinner for my wife and I, the BEST part of the meal was that they said they would reverse the charges. 
HORRIBLE. 
Absolute dog food. 
We got the brisket, chicken and baby back ribs. 
The chicken was yellow grey, sweaty and over cooked with the flavor of old salt brine. Shriveled up skin that had seen better days. Nasty.
The baby back ribs had a quarter inch chewy crust, were grey throughout and absolutely horrible. Reheated garbage. Over salted, consistency of jerky. Drenched in salty Bbq sauce to cover...
The brisket was light grey, over cooked, fatty and over salted. 
What an absolute mess. 
I don't know if they serve day(+) old crap to unsuspecting carry out customers or if they serve this horse shit to in house customers too.  
BTW - two plates of horse crap - $54 with tip. I will be checking my bank statement daily, I don't trust they are competent enough to reverse the charges on my card either.

Pho Phuong's menu boasts an intimidating amount of choices, but for our appetizer we opted for the Bo Bia (fresh cold rice paper rolls with Vietnamese sausage, jicama, dried shrimp, and fried egg). I've had a lot of similar rolls in my life but this was definitely one of the most stuffed I've ever sampled. The whole thing was definitely above average, although I'll be honest and admit the sausage didn't do much for me (and even seemed out of place). The dipping sauce was top-notch, too.

For my main, I opted for the Bun 4 Mau (House special vermicelli with beef roll wrapped with tropical leaves, BBQ beef roll, spicy satay beef roll, and shrimp wrapped on sugar cane). This was definitely one of the better variations on Bun I've had as of late, and the various meats included were all quite tasty. I especially dug the beef roll wrapped with tropical leaves, as it was certainly different from anything I've eaten before. My one complaint with this dish was that the portion was pretty small.

5,Hotel Schmidener Eintracht,"Die Schmidener Eintracht, mag zwar auf den ersten Blick etwas alt aussehen, doch wenn man sich genauer umschaut und die liebevolle Deko genauer wahrnimmt, fühlt man sich direkt wohl, vorallem im Winter wenn es draußen kalt ist und drinnen warm und gemütlich mit vielen Kerzen.
Der Altersdurschnitt war bei meinem Besuch 35-45, da mein Besuch in der Vorweihnachtszeit war, war das Lokal sehr gut besucht. Doch auch in teilweise stressigen Momenten, wurde ich stets von den zwei lieben Kellnerinnen bedient. Sie waren sehr aufmerksam und wir wurden trotz vielen Gästen sehr schnell bedient.
Nun zum Wichtigsten, dem Essen.
Schon die Speisekarte versprach viel. Von allem war etwas dabei, aber trotzdem war die Karte nicht zu groß, was mir persönlich immer sehr wichtig ist.
Als Vorspeise bestellte mein man sich ein Kressesüppchen mit Garnelen und ich eine einfache Maultaschensuppe. Beides war hervorragend. Das Kressesüppchen war herrlich cremig und meine Maultaschensuppe kann ich auch nur weiterempfelen (ich hab mir auch gleich 4 Stück mit nach Hause genommen, muss man aber Glück haben :-) ).
Als Hauptgang bestellte mein Mann sich Kalbsnieren mit Bratkartoffeln, es war einfach super lecker! Ich bestellte mir die Wiener Schnitzel, es war genau so wie ich es mir vorgestellt habe. Die Schnitzel waren schön dünn und die Panade hob sich vom Fleisch ab, das ist ein Zeichen, dass alles sehr frisch ist. Meine Beilage war ein großer Salat. Dieser war mit zwei Soßen angemacht. Beide auch sehr lecker. Auch der Salat war frisch.
Das einzige was ich auszusetzen hatte, dass die Portionen sehr groß sind :-)
Mein Fazit:

4,Ho Shin Tang,"Three of us went last weekend to try it out.  We ordered dolsot bibimbap (mixed rice in stone bowl), chicken kampoongi (spicy and sweet battered chicken) and jajangmyun/jamppong mixed bowl (noodle with black bean sauce and noodle in spicy broth with seafood).   Banchan/side dishes were very fresh.  We received kimchi, kkakdugi (radish kimchi), bean sprout salad, Chinese green and lily bud salad.  The only place I've ever been to, in and around Toronto that has dried lily buds salad as side dish!  
I can't personally speak for the bibimbap but my friend was very happy with it. The chicken dish was great: light batter with real pieces of chicken.  (I know some places coat gobs of batter on tiny pieces of meat/gristle...)  Although we are used to saucier version, this restaurant had it more dry but was still very tasty.  And the most exciting part, I finally have a great jajangmyun restaurant in my neighborhood!  Perfect texture noodles, nice chewiness, and sauce was not too greasy.

The salad dressing is their signature and available on all the tables. It's definitely not a light dressing though, so if you want something lighter, ask for the lemon vinaigrette on the side instead.

1,Ah-So,"Friday, Jan 13, 2017. The nightly manager on duty of Ah-So, named Joe, stepped into the next door tattoo shop to shut down their business for the night. Friday the 13th is a tattoo sale day where a certain tattoo can be 13$ + 7$ tip to the artist. A great day for their businesses to bring in a ton of sales. Joe took it upon himself, acting as if he had some legal authority, to close down Iconic Tattoo for their last 3 hours of operation. 
(Keep in mind, a lot of folks were pouring in for these tattoos. So the wait time was up towards an hour or two.) 
Iconic tattoo advised customers of the wait time, whom were all okay with it, and most customers waiting went into the Ah-So for drinks and food while waiting throughout the entire day. 
So, for some measly little night manager Joe to put a halt on another business's sales is beyond ridiculous, almost childish. Childish in the sense that he was mad the tattoo shop was getting more business than his restaurant, so just had to put a stop to it. Ridiculous! 
Look if Joe had any background on management and sales, which are basically the first two requirements of a managers position, he would've used this influx of potential customers to his advantage to increase sales. Put up a sign joe, work with the tattoo shop owner to send over the customers while they wait!!! CREATE A SYMBIOTIC RELATIONSHIP WITH THOSE AROUND YOU JOE, so everyone can benefit! 
I don't know Joe personally, but he's got a head full of hot air to be shutting down another business. Was Joe thinking level headed? No, and quite frankly Joe doesn't deserve that position.",2017-01-17,Glendale,-112.1898243,33.6377501,"['Japanese', 'Restaurants', 'Steakhouses', 'Specialty Food', 'Ethnic Food', 'Sushi Bars', 'Food']"
1,Joe's Doughs,"When I first heard of Joe's Doughs I was so excited to have a great donut shop in the neighborhood. I really do want to like this place but after trying three times, I think I'd rather go somewhere that is more reliable. 

On my first visit, we had two maple donuts that were good. On the second visit, there were no donuts at all, just coffee. On my third visit (today), I was told that the Saturday Specials ""weren't ready yet."" I would believe that at almost 9am on a Saturday that you should have your daily specials prepared. 

I'm sure this feedback will not be well received by the company/owner based on previous interactions that I've witnessed on social media. For the sake of the neighborhood, I do wish Joe's Doughs the best of luck but that will most likely require some changes to their current practices.",2016-10-15,Charlotte,-80.820234412,35.2360953319,"['Breakfast & Brunch', 'Food', 'Bakeries', 'Donuts', 'Restaurants']"
5,Joe's Diner,Drove by the diner the other day and noticed it replaced the Chinese buffet.   I was stoked so today the hubby and I went there for a Sunday morning breakfast; something we used to do a lot when we were first married.  We got there right before 10 and had no problem parking and were seated right away.  The owner was our waitress and the staff was friendly.  We gad some delicious Arbuckle's coffee which was hot too!  Love they had Sweet N' Lo too.  The hubby had the Western Omelet which came HUGE with a generous side of seasoned home fries and toast or buscuit.  He had whole wheat toast and enjoyed the homemade apple butter as well.  I had 2 eggs over easy (perfect ) which came with the same huge side of home fries and toast or biscuit.   I had the toast and homemade blueberry jam which was FANTASTIC!

3,Urban Turban,"This afternoon my family visited this place in Vegas. I tried calling them to find out if they are still serving lunch but no body picked up the phone. I took a chance and went there.  I asked the hostess if we can order from the menu for our children and she said she was not sure.  She said she will check with the chef but never got back to us. We were given a table and after few minutes we decided to go to the buffet as we were not given an answer. They have separated meat dishes and non-meat dishes into two areas.. I thought that was a good way for vegetarians.  They had the typical Indian items such as a salad, vegetable dishes, lentil dish, fritters, curry etc. Their bread (Naan ) was fresh as they run out of their pre-made Naan bread.  I enjoyed the different theme throughout the restaurant such as an Indian Auto Rickshow and framed cartoon pictures of Bombay.Overall a good place to stop during your Vegas trip if you are tired of the casino food.",2015-12-29,Las Vegas,-115.15426950000001,36.1186973,"['Halal', 'Buffets', 'Tapas Bars', 'Indian', 'Vegetarian', 'Restaurants', 'Cocktail Bars', 'Bars', 'Nightlife']"
3,Aiello's Pizza,"This was the first pizza I ate in the 'burgh after living in NY for a number of years.

One of the other reviewers is correct in that the sauce is sweeter than a NY style pie.

However, despite noting the sweetness my wife and I made pigs of ourselves!

We loved the melty and yet bubbly and just perfectly browned cheese. I liked the smaller cuts--though it led to eating too many slices. 

This place was definitely worth it and about the same price as we're used to from NY. We ate plain cheese though so maybe that explains it.

I would say the pizza tastes different from what we make for ourselves, but we will definitely have it again.

I wouldn't recommend eating in the store since it's really hot from all the pizza ovens. We got our pizza to go, and it was hot enough that we didn't have to microwave it after a 10 min walk home.",2010-08-08,Pittsburgh,-79.9231982,40.43326079999999,"['Pizza', 'Restaurants', 'Italian']"

3,Nobu,"Let me start by saying that the food was excellent.  The reason the place doesn't get 5 or even 4 stars is the service was NOT on the up and up.  

I went with 5 other guys celebrating a friend's last days as a bachelor.  When we arrived we were told by our waiter that ""we don't have printed menus, but tell me what types of things you like and I'll customize the menu for you"".   Odd...  This should have raised a red flag right there.  

""Well, obviously we'd like some sushi.  That's why we're here.""
""Any non-sushi eaters?""
A couple of guys raise their hands...
""Yeah, bring out a chicken dish or something else non-seafood.""
""Okay, I'll get you guys started.""

The waiter started bringing out food one platter at a time.  Lobster Tail salad...  Kobe Beef Carpacio (something like that)...  Some kind of tasty dumplings...  3 complete fillet mignon dinners...  and after a break...  2 HUGE platters of sushi!!   When all was said and done, we had been brought enough food for probably 10-12 very hungry people!  Our ""customized"" menu for 6 people consisted of 5 large platters of food PLUS 3 complete steak dinners.

When we questioned our waiter, his response was ""Well that's what you said you wanted.""  We certainly did NOT want enough food for 12 people.  By the time the sushi came out, we were all stuffed... and this was a group of 6 guys that can really eat.  Of course, we were charged for all of this excessive food that ended up going to waste.  The bill was $1200...  $200 bucks a head.  I don't think I would have had a problem paying $200 for dinner, it was the fact that I had to pay for all this extra food that was unnecessary that bothered me.

To add insult to injury, as we were leaving the restaurant, a table was being seated right in front of us... all the diners had menus in hand.",2007-10-08,Las Vegas,-115.153493285,36.1091636136,"['Restaurants', 'Sushi Bars', 'Japanese']"

My drink sat empty for about 15-20 minutes before he asked if I wanted another one. We ordered food to go after sitting there for 1 1/2 hours. All I ate were fries and a beer.

We started out with the appetizer that I can't spell with the beef carpacio  think is how you say it. Melt in your mouth truffle explosion of goodness! Followed by us splitting the 18oz bone in ribeye which was perfectly charred and came with 4 sauces on the side. A side of the mac and cheese which was to die for and then also a side order of the bone marrow. The marrow presentation was rustic and ow so savory. My wife was a little of put by the Fred Flintstone bone, but I really appreciated the look. Also we was new to eating marrow and the wait or actually set us up our first piece of brioche to show us how it's done! And finally for dessert they brought us out a comp molten cake and ice cream which delivered epic flavor. I recommend splitting the steaks above 16oz and you won't fill over stuffed afterwards and be able to enjoy your night rather then slipping into a blissful food coma! The service was top notch, I don't believe my ice tea or water went below half the entire night.",2016-12-13,Las Vegas,-115.17713073899999,36.1071523736,"['Steakhouses', 'Restaurants']"
3,Thai Spice,"I ordered takeout from Thai Spice on the way home from work last night. It had been one of those days where I started looking at the clock on my computer at 10am, wishing it was 6 already. I called in my order when I was about 20 minutes away and was quoted the same amount of time for pickup. And true to their word, they were bringing my order up from the kitchen as I was walking in the door. Points to Thai Spice for punctuality! There is nothing that irritates me more when I am tired and just want to go home than waiting an extra 10 minutes than quoted for takeout. I ordered the Pad Thai and my boyfriend ordered the garlic beef. As I mentioned before, my boyfriend is an Asian food snob. I always get nervous trying new Asian restaurants with him because if one little thing is wrong (my god, they put mushrooms in Mongolian beef?! How DARE they! That's not authentic!) I hear about it for the rest of the meal. And I was in no mood for that last night. But luckily he was happy with his garlic beef. The quality of beef was good, and the sauce had a great flavor. My Pad Thai was...ok. I was in such a rush ordering, I didn't specify how spicy I wanted it. But then again, the girl taking my order didn't ask either. So I guess she just assumed I wanted it mild. And mild it was. All the ingredients were fresh and good, but it was missing some kick. I would order it again, but next time I'll make sure to ask for it hot. The Siam rolls we got were tasty little treats and the summer rolls were pretty good too. The only issue I had is that she packed the summer rolls in with our hot food, so they were a little warm by the time we got home. I prefer my summer rolls chilled.

They are as good as most any fine dining restaurant, but it has the price tag of an Outback or a Cheesecake Factory. While they have great pizza, steaks, pasta, burgers, chicken, and weekly/seasonal specials, the big surprise is their fish. Fresh, quality seafood is hard to find in AZ, and is almost nonexistent outside of big chains that can fly theirs in cheap. Thankfully, RW&B is close to home and is decently affordable.

4,The One That Got Away,"I eat here probably once a week.  Line ups can be long during the lunch rush and aside from the soup and side salads everything is made fresh so there can be a little bit of a wait. 

Their fish wraps are huge and delicious and are my favorite but they are incredibly messy.  If you are a slow eater (like me) your wrap will inevitably leak torrents of pico de gallo (et al) juices all over you.  Not sayin to avoid the wraps because of this, just keep it in mind as it could be very embarrassing with certain dining companions.  The fish tacos on the other hand are almost as messy yet somehow less flavourful (would have thought they'd have similar ingredients and taste but they don't).  The tacos are made with fried fish, but wraps by default are grilled...after discovering the awesome crunchy texture of the taco's I've been asking them to fry my fish for the wraps, AMAZING!

I've also had their fish and chips (ok), salmon burger (sooooo good), fish fillet (also good) and their lobster roll (a bit meh and doesn't live up to it's potential).

What I like about this place is they pack up the food for to go orders in a way that lets steam escape and everything stays crispy.  It seems like such a simple thing but there are other fish and chip places that don't do this and their food becomes a soggy disappointment.",2013-02-08,Toronto,-79.3998429,43.6444694,"['Restaurants', 'Fish & Chips', 'Sandwiches', 'Soup']"

1,Del Taco,"This is the Del Taco located on Sunset Road,directly across the street from the Galaxy Luxury Theater. 

On the way to go see Avengers: Age of Ultron last night (fun, fun movie , btw), we stopped by here to grab some burritos to sneak into the theater. (*Shhhhhhhh, don't tell anyone*)

We pull up, ordered 2 Del Beef Burritos and were told to pull forward. Cool. Just as we were pulling forward, the girl who took our order says, ""It's gonna be a while""

Wait. what?

We pulled forward with one vehicle in front of us. We wait.....and wait...and wait. After 12 minutes I notice that it  appears that the vehicle in front of us is not pulled up to the window. In fact, it is about 5 feet BEHIND the window. There were four twenty something males in the car. So I approached the vehicle and said, ""Hey...what's going on here?"" 

They explained that they were told to back up from the window from the girl inside and that they were as annoyed as I was because they had waited almost 15 minutes for 3 cheeseburgers. They offered to pull up if they didnt get their burgers in the next few minutes so we could get out of there. 

At the 16 minute mark of my wait, the guys in front of me get their order and pull off. I pulled up and paid for the burritos expecting to just grab the bag and go. After all, previews have now started for our movie.

The girl collects the money and closes the window and walks off. I looked at my friend and literally said, ""Are you F*cking kidding me??"" This is about 18 minutes in. 

I had had enough. I told the girl to give me my money back. This was BEYOND rediculous. By the time I pulled away it was 23 minutes. 23 MINUTES! Nothing fast about this food at all!

When I first pulled up to order, she should have said they were having issues and that there would be a long wait. I would have backed out and been on my merry little way. Slipping in a ""It'll be a while"" as you pull forward does not cut the mustard. 

THESE are the people that want $15 an hour??? Are you out of your flippin', ever loving minds??

Never again. That $28 soda and popcorn is much more appealing than going through this again. Hell, a root canal sounds more enticing..

Our server was Brendan who was incredibly friendly, attentive to our needs, and very helpful, always with a genuine smile on his face.

 The environment is very wild and fun, noisy with loud lightning and wildlife sound effects as well as animatronic gorillas and waterfalls.  My favorite part of the decor was the giant mushroom that housed the bar in the middle of the restaurant with the animal barstools and bubble walls.

For my first visit to a Rainforest Cafe this was a delightful adventure!",2014-07-01,Las Vegas,-115.172141489,36.1086615706,"['Restaurants', 'American (Traditional)']"
5,Grimaldi's Pizzeria,"We went here twice during spring training/spring break last week- it was THAT good! I'm hungry now just thinking about their delicious pizza. Both times we got a table without waiting, although it was very crowded- a good sign. 

The first time, my daughter and I shared a meatball and mushroom pizza with tomato sauce. The crust is fabulous! She liked folding it over to eat ""new york style"" so I tried that too and it actually did make it thicker and chewier- may have started a new tradition in eating style. Ha. Hubby and son shared a pepperoni and it was equally good. The pepperonis are miniature in size, but great in quantity used, and cooked perfectly where they crisp up a bit on the edges. Yum!

The second trip, son and I decided to try the ricotta cheese pizza without red sauce (they use garlic and olive oil instead), and the server recommended sausage and onion. We got sausage and mushroom (I would have gotten onion too, but for the boy). Oh my gosh. Heavenly!!!!! Loved the ricotta combo. Hubby and daughter enjoyed pepperoni and meatball with red sauce. 

We shared a large Caesar both times, which was plentiful. I would have preferred trying one of their other salads, but oh well. Gave in for the sake of the family. 

The staff was pleasant and friendly both times as well. The manager came over and talked with us the second trip, when he saw my son's lacrosse tshirt- struck up a lax conversation. Fun. Oh- and our server the first time told us we got $5 off because of our hotel, and the hotel shuttle took us and picked us up. Double bonus.

We will DEFINITELY be back here on our next trip to Scottsdale! I can't wait!!!",2012-03-22,Scottsdale,-111.9264692,33.4937779,"['Pizza', 'Restaurants', 'Salad']"

4,Watami Japanese Seafood Buffet & Grill,"Yelp lead us to this awesome sushi buffet!

When you think of strip mall sushi... you are bound to also think of an assortment of horrible complications from eating it.

But alas - Watami to the rescue!  The wide variety of sushi and assortment of Chinese dishes is truly remarkable for the price.  I have been here countless times, but only for lunch... and one thing we learned - the food is better if you go close to opening.  

I'd skip the dessert bar... it's all mediocre.  And you probably don't want to use the restroom (it's a little gross).  

However... we did notice the family who owns and runs the restaurant actually serving themselves from the buffet and sitting down to eat.  This made us feel much more comfortable about Watami!

If you keep your expectations reasonable - you will be happy.  This will never be ""the best thing"" you've ever eaten... but it can definitely be a pleasant and satisfying experience!",2013-11-30,Parma,-81.7398702,41.382427,"['Japanese', 'Seafood', 'Restaurants', 'Buffets', 'Sushi Bars']"
2,HUSH,"I ended up at HUSH for lunch with a group of friends on a Thursday afternoon. Being a resident of Yonge & Eg, I've always considered the King West-ish area to be somewhat foreign. The lesser known restaurants never seemed worthy of a visit, which I considered more like fixtures of a landscape that scrolled by through a streetcar window, than actual establishments that people frequently patronized. I think HUSH falls perfectly into this category for me. 

The patios were busy, but not crowded. The street-front patio is pretty small and I don't think I would feel comfortable eating in it, being so close to the pedestrian traffic. It seems ideal for drinks and people-watching though. The rooftop patio is much larger and can accommodate groups.

My impression of this place was poor, mainly due to the service. There were plenty of servers, but it took a really long time to get our order. It took even longer to get it right. We basically felt ignored for the entire meal. 

Thankfully the food was alright. I tried the fish and chips which was a generous portion. They didn't have any features that day though, which I wasn't aware of until I tried ordering it. That meant they didn't have any pasta... at all. 

Maybe we just had poor luck with our server. He might have been new. There was a pretty comical incident where he was walking out with a pint of beer for a customer, and a massive bee landed on the rim of the glass. He kind of watched it sit there, before it flew off. He then started walking towards the customer before seeing us, watching him almost make a bad decision. He turned around and went back to the bar to get a new pint (at least I hope). 

So, the next time you're on the 504 streetcar, wondering what goes on in those restaurants along King, rest assured that people are eating meals and drinking beers, possibly contaminated by bee germs, eating average food, and being treated to mediocre service.",2013-06-21,Toronto,-79.39027270000001,43.6463659,"['Restaurants', 'Canadian (New)', 'Nightlife', 'Bars', 'Burgers']"
4,Monta Ramen,"Keep in mind, a 4.5 would probably be spot on. I went here on my last trip to Vegas in Fall of 2013 and hadn't had time to review it.  I just came back from a Vegas trip where I made 2 trips here it was that good.  Keep in mind, this little food shopping plaza is a gem in general if you have a car to drive off the strip.

My first time on this recent trip, I went with one of their specials, Kuro Black Garlic Oil Ramen.  There was this amazing, but not overly powerful garlic flavor. I somewhat wish it was more noticeable to be honest.  But everything else in terms of the noodles, chasu and broth was spot on.  I  have a soft spot for corn and an egg... and extra noodle of course =D

My second visit on this recent trip was... right before my flight actually.  I went with my sure bet, the delicious Spicy Tonkotsu Ramen.  Again, the broth was very tasty and flavorful.  The spice is OK, but not as spicy as I probably would have liked/tolerated.  

Until I can find better, my go to ramen/hangover spot.",2014-05-27,Las Vegas,-115.2096534,36.1270432,"['Japanese', 'Restaurants', 'Noodles', 'Ramen']"

3,Burrito Bandidos,"I was craving some burritos, so I finally decided to check out Burrito Bandidos on Bloor ST. I've always been a bit wary of Tex-Mex, because the flavors never really meet my expectations. In regards to flavors, Burrito Bandidos is definitely a step ahead of places like Taco Ball and Taco Time. 
 
I had the small pulled pork burrito with everything on it for $6.15. The burritos are freshly made in front of you, so you might have to wait longer than most fast-food joints. My burrito took about 10-15 minutes, and the restaurant was empty.

Burrito Bandidos is more of a take-out place. This location's eat-in area is a bit cramped, and only accommodates 3-4 people. 

The burrito was huge! The hot sauce was one of the hottest I've had in Toronto, and that's a good thing! All the flavors were there, and it tasted fresh. But... There's always a but... There were some minor problems: the pork was dry, and the burrito was way too greasy. I couldn't even finish the whole thing because it was so big! Halfway through, I just gave up. 

Burrito Bandidos is still better than Taco Bell and Taco Time, but not by much.",2010-10-26,Toronto,-79.4054889679,43.666288396000006,"['Restaurants', 'Tex-Mex']"

2,Chompie's Deli,"I have tried Chompie's 3 times that will probably be all for me.  today it was a half turkey sandwich, soup and slaw.

The slaw of ok but tiny.  The chicken noodle was way to heavy on celery and light on carrots and onion.  

The turkey sandwich was a giant pile of turkey on thin torn bread, there was no balance and no spread.  The turkey itself was cooked and sliced decently but it was under seasoned.  

I don't get the love for this place.",2013-10-29,Chandler,-111.901330948,33.2976955302,"['Caterers', 'Event Planning & Services', 'Breakfast & Brunch', 'Bagels', 'Bakeries', 'Sandwiches', 'Food', 'Restaurants', 'Delis']"

5,Golden Corral,"I ate here last night with my family and was very pleased with the place.  We went right at dinner time and they weren't very busy at all.  We had no problems finding a table to accomidate my family of 5.  The plates and silverware were stacked at the front and was easily accessed. 

The food was something else.  I had some Louisiana chicken and rice that was really good and I also had some Beef Pot Roast that was loscious and tender, and some mashed potatoes and gravy that reminded me of the comfort food of my mothers.  My wife did have a slice of their meatloaf and it was very dry and neutral on the taste.  Probably because of how dry it was.  The desserts were the average kind of desserts and were tasty but not out of this world.

The waitress was very attentive and did a wonderful job with my three young children and all their demands.  The place was very clean and organized.   We will come to this location again even though there is one closer to our home.",2010-10-21,Goodyear,-112.3417602,33.45112460000001,"['Buffets', 'Restaurants']"
5,Hash House A Go Go,"Hash House A Go Go is my favorite restaurant in the world to eat breakfast. I spent 5 days in Las Vegas last week and I ate there twice, even with a rule that I wouldn't eat at the same place more than once. There are way too many great things I can say about this establishment, so I'll stick to my favorites:

-- The obscure, one-of-a-kind menu: They don't just do chicken and waffles, they do Sage Fried Chicken and Waffles. They don't just do a hash or a scramble, they put together a work of art with fried chicken, bacon, hash browns, cheese, eggs, lettuce and tomato on a plate with the most delicious gravy sauce you'd ever taste on a big ole plate.
-- The service: Every waiter and waitress is trained to LOVE what they do. Either that, or they literally cherish their craft. They are psyched to be your waiter and to get you your food as fast as possible.
-- No heat lamps: When food is finished, it's brought out to your table immediately. They don't wait for everyone's food to be prepared and then bring it out and 1 or 2 dishes are cooler. It should be done this way at every restaurant.
-- Artwork: Across the restaurant, celebrities has signed menus and given them feedback about how perfect their menu is. And those celebrities are right.

This is a restaurant in which the food speaks for itself. Man Vs. Food's Adam Richman recently visited and showed how perfect this institution is. It's almost unbelievable how food can have this much flavor. My girlfriend's pancake was as big as a large pizza and tasted like it was injected with flavor. Just the best.

If you're in Vegas, get into Hash House A Go Go immediately and thank me later.",2013-01-19,Las Vegas,-115.17124454,36.1178829948,"['Restaurants', 'Breakfast & Brunch', 'American (New)']"

4,FEZ,"Fez is BY FAR my favorite place to take people who are new to the midtown area.  Not only does it stand out as something different than you'll find anywhere else in Phoenix but it also provides top culinary options that will satisfy most palates.

There are a few gripes about Fez though.  The first is that parking can be a headache when they are busy.  Kinkos takes up most of the good spots.  The second is that Fez is really a gay bar masquerading as a restaurant.  Not that having gay clientele is a problem but the servers will only pay attention to you if you are not a co-ed group.  I get terrible service when I take my wife or we go with other couples.  When I bring a guy friend, we are always immediately tended to.  

The drink selection is good but they don't have a blender so don't expect anything slushy.  The drink menu consists of martinis of all different flavor combination and are quite popular.  The pomegranate one seems to be a favorite of my friends.

The food selection is a bit overwhelming upon reading the menu.  Arugula, pears, saffron; all sorts of strange additions to traditional American plates.  The wife always orders the lamb chops with pesto.  She swears by them.  I always get the Fez Burger.  It is, by far, the best burger in Phoenix.  The bbq sauce's tangy-ness mixed with the sweet pear makes the burger unbelievable.  Unfortunately, the salad that accompanies the Fez Burger is one of the worst combination I have ever been forced to eat.  

Fez is a lounge type environment.  Some of the tables are couches, some are four tops, and some are high tops.  There is usually some techno music playing but it is not too loud to disturb your conversation.  They have a patio that, assuming they still allow this, will let you bring your dogs out with you.  I am so glad that they survived the light rail construction and cannot wait to go back.",2008-12-16,Phoenix,-112.07349769999999,33.491695299999996,"['American (New)', 'Lounges', 'Bars', 'Mediterranean', 'Nightlife', 'Restaurants']"

I've eaten at expensive NYC restaurants and ordered seafood towers that cost MORE than that but had double the amount of good. I told the waiter I thought the tower was really weak and he said I could order more food, but the bill was already well over 200 with drinks and appetizers so I thought it was best to call it quits. This is my first time in town and I know that everything is very expensive here, but come on give me a break.

Sitting inside is a very different experience than sitting outside; tonight there was no outside seating so we were forced indoors and the experience was not as good. I highly suggest outdoors if possible. The servers are usually young kids who don't have much experience, so don't expect a lot in that department.

Since moving to the Charlotte area in june 2015, this has hands down become my favorite place to get a great burger. I've been here approx 6 times in the last 6 months, most recently a few days ago. I've never received bad service or my order wrong or improperly cooked meal. It's a bar/pub/tavern experience so it is noisy, but the food and people are great and it features sports on tv, a pool table, and skee ball which my kid loves. There is also a huge outdoor seating area when temps are milder.

3,Meat & Potatoes,"My girlfriend and I went here after we saw a show downtown. I had heard great things about M&P and was super excited. However, I was pretty disappointed with my experience.

I got the lamb burger and my girlfriend got the duck.

The lamb burger was not good. I thought the meat was spongy and didn't taste fresh. I was pretty sad, since I was expecting to be blown away.

The duck, however, was delicious. It was very well cooked. The skin was nice and crispy and the meat was tender. The plate came in three parts on a long plate. A salad, pierogies, and the duck. The flavors from each were good on their own, but to me, they felt like three separate dishes. I didn't feel any unifying theme between them.

Perhaps it was my fault that I didn't get the steak. I think I will try again someday in the future.",2015-08-16,Pittsburgh,-80.0011037908,40.4431445863,"['Restaurants', 'Meat Shops', 'Specialty Food', 'Food', 'Steakhouses', 'Gastropubs', 'American (New)']"

3,Acacia Fine Foods,"This is a food court style eatery. You first order at the back counter and tell them where you will be sitting. Once you've sat down they will serve you drinks (and if you didn't order drinks, they will offer complimentary water). This is followed by serving you with freshly baked pita bread. Eat it when it's hot and soft. Then they will serve your order and bon appetite! (all in about 15 mins; very fast service.)

You can get full with $10 of food here. I usually get the beef & chicken shawarma plate. Very fulfilling and tasty.

They've had a few minor hiccups in their service at times, like they would forget to give you pita bread at the beginning or just walk pass you without asking if you wanted water. Sometimes they even forget give you all the right sauces and dips that go with your order. But don't hesitate to call upon the 3-4 servers they have running around all the time.

Justification for 3 stars; Great food, fills up the tummy but at times you may go unnoticed there.

Food: American Wagyu boneless ribeye. A little bit on the crewy side. They took out the big chunk of fat in it, so it felt more like a New York strip. How ever it is still good!

They offer 3 types of mustard to go with the steak. I love the wine based mustard.

It's to no surprise to me when we arrive at this old looking diner located the west end of Queen St. It's got a nice, warm toasty feel to it. It definitely felt like an old diner with the high bar stools located at the front by the entrance, and the rest of the restaurant was sectioned off by cute small booths on the side fitted for four and a few tables near the back. We were a party of five so we had to do a bit of waiting before we got an open table to fit all of us. It was about a 20 minute wait which is not bad for a Saturday. I ordered the Avacado Toast ($12). I absolutely love eating or drinking anything with avacodo in it and usually have them plain with a light sprinkle of salt-pepper on toast as a quick 'on the go' breakfast. Simple! However, they added a few ingredients such as eggs, sweet and hot pepper so I wanted to give that a try. The plate was filled with colours of green, yellow and red which made it look esthetically pleasing when I saw plates of them coming out of the kitchen behind us. It was different than how I usually prepared avacodos, sadly there was nothing that really blew me away except getting my avacodo fix for the day.

Those who worry that a French restaurant is stuffy can relax. The sommelier wanders around in jeans and a casual shirt to help people choose just the right beverage. The craft beers from Ontario (wish there were more variety) have cheeky names.
Allow yourself a cone of onion rings (the only thing French is French-fied) to taste how a gifted chef can pump them way up. Same goes for the French Fries.
I've never had steak tartare before, and if you're the same, this is the right place to try it; beautifully served and delicious.
In my book, The No-Nonsense Guide to World Food, i discuss the trend known as fusion -- the mix and match of various traditions and cuisines that is happening around the world. At its worst, it is Americanization with junk food. At its best, it's something like this -- a fusion of French and Italian and pop North American.
The Beach only has two gourmet quality restaurants in terms of food quality and  overall atmosphere, and this is one of them. 
If you're worried about the final price tab, do as we did both times. Order three appetizers and a drink. The staff are fine with that.
If you come late, the chef comes around to chat and enjoy some fresh air a a breeze after an exhausting shift in a hot kitchen. A very charming fellow, and I like the tradition of meeting the chef who made your dinner and the sommelier who chooses drinks, rather than treating a night out as an anonymous relationship. 
My No-Nonsense Guide also emphasizes the way food has become personalized, rather than commodified, over the past 15 years, and this place exemplifies that shift.",2014-07-02,Toronto,-79.2897816777,43.67221837060001,"['French', 'Italian', 'Restaurants']"

We got a checklist of the food we would like to order, and the menu had lots of variety (except they didn't have sashimi). It consisted of maki rolls, nigiri, teriyaki, skewers, tempura and desserts. There were less brown rice options compared to white rice, but to have brown rice at no extra cost was very generous already. You either get EIGHT maki rolls or SIX, and they all taste pretty great. I was not fond of Echo Sushi Roll, however, which was 90% mayonnaise and 10% salmon. 

If you order calamari or fried banana, the portions are very tiny. They are basically side-dish size. To sum it up, if you order anything that is NOT sushi, the portion will be small.

They also have a full room of pool tables if you're in to that sort of thing.  I head straight to the arcade to play one of the following: big buck safari hunt, pop-a-shot (basketball), ski ball, air hockey, and maybe a racing game.  All of their games are nice and new and they rarely have games that are out of order.  The service here is usually pretty slow so you'll probably have to wait around for a bit if you have any questions or need anything.  Fortunately you can grab a playing card from an automated machine without having to deal with anyone.",2010-10-09,Concord,-80.72426340000001,35.371099,"['Arcades', 'Restaurants', 'American (Traditional)', 'Arts & Entertainment']"
5,MOD Pizza,"Had it today for the first time. I had the mod sized cheese pizza to see what that was like alone. It was amazing. One of the best pizzas I've ever had in Arizona. For such a quick baked pizza, they do more well than these other franchised places you see. That says a lot about a pizza. You know what else says a lot about a pizza? When that cheese is so frikkn stretchy and it just keeps going and going while you're biting at it. Unlike other places the cheese frikkn comes off. I was pretty impressed, and I grew up in New Jersey and New York, where we had the most amazing frikkn pizza.

5,Viva Las Arepas,"I don't think I've tried authentic Venezuelan food before trying out this place. But I have to admit I don't know how much I'd like it after eating here! It made me fall in love with Venezuelan cuisine! 

When I came it was just a food hut on the corner of Las Vegas Blvd and Wyoming, but now I hear it's actually branched out and opened as a restaurant just a walk away from it. I guess it has turned into a hot dog stand now. 

Anyway, you can get both cold and hot arepas. They are decently priced, ranging from $2 - $5 so obviously you can't just have one! But before you go all crazy and order everything off the menu, let me tell you they can be quite filling! I would suggest two of them and an empanada constituting a full meal. I've tried the Roasted Pork Butt with tomato slices - FANTASTIC, beef tongue arepa - FANTASTIC times 2, and the Reina Pepiada which is chicken breast, avocado, mayonnaise, and cilantro - not as good as the beef arepas, but still tasty. I have also tried their empanadas. Really really good. Make sure to try the arepas with the special sauces they have for you to use. 

This place overall is the best place to go before a night out downtown for a quick, inexpensive, and absolutely delicious meal.",2013-03-26,Las Vegas,-115.15254548,36.1512686085,"['Venezuelan', 'Food Stands', 'Restaurants', 'Latin American']"

I couldn't even eat it, the shrimp tasted super fishy as if it were rotten. The egg roll was soggy and cold. I ended up eating only the rice.  Also, VERY EXPENSIVE! Total for the above was $24! Beware of the delivery guy who will try to scam you for a bigger tip! I gave him $30 for the $24 order and asked for $2 back (which would give him a generous $4 tip in addition to the $2 ""deliver fee""). He claimed he didn't have any one dollar bills. (Dude, you have ONE JOB! Hand me my order and cash me out!) Rather than stiff him, I gave him the entire $30 to keep...so my inedible meal cost $22 with an $8 tip!

3,Wan Fu,"The atmosphere of this restaurant is five star.  Decor and lighting set a great mood. I actually felt a bit under dressed in a tee-shirt and jeans but I wasn't the only one dressed so casually.  The food was so so.  If you like Americanized Chinese you will be delighted as it was certainly a cut above most with that sort of menu.  I, on the other hand, love Chinese cuisine and even cook it extensively at home and do not appreciate the hybridization so much.  I ordered the tofu vegetable soup, pork dumplings, gai lan with oyster sauce, eggplant in garlic sauce, and the steamed basa in black bean sauce.  The soup had a nice chicken broth but the tofu was lacking, just a couple slivers.  The vegetables in the soup were a frozen medley* variety with the processed baby carrots, snow peas, and cauliflower.  The pork dumplings were certainly made in house and quite good. The gai lan with oyster sauce was actually shanghi tips (baby bok choy) with a thin brown sauce that was quite light in flavor and a sprinkling of jarred minced garlic ontop, not what we ordered (or on the menu as we could tell).  The eggplant in garlic sauce came to the table as eggplant with a szechuan style sweet and sour sauce.  The fish came to the table as a steamed fillet on a plate with the same frozen vegetable* ontop except the medley was peppers, onions, carrot, broccoli.  The sauce was not radically different than the sauce accompanying the shanghi tips with the addition of a sprinkling of fermented black beans in lieu of the garlic.  We gobbled it up, afterall it was Thanksgiving for these out-of-towners, and it wasn't bad.  In the end the name says it all: an American imitating a Chinese accent asking if you ""want food"".

5,Le Riverain,"Drove out for a weekend adventure at the Riverain after repeated urgings from Tasha C, and if Tash thinks you should eat somewhere or meet someone you shout get on that, toute sweet. 

Ormstown is adorable, first of all, and the Riverain is a total family run project that exudes friendship, love and care for quality ingredients. Everything Summer brought to the table elicited a beaming refrain of ""it's homemade!"" or ""it's from a baker/farmer/dairy down the street!"" or ""it's my favourite!"" And she was not wrong about the deliciousness of things, or the freshness, or the feeling of local love. We tried the daily special, which was a corned beef with cabbage, and the filet mignon with bacon gravy, and the blue cheese and bacon poutine. Everything was cozy and fresh made and super flavourful, but the filet mignon was the all out winner for sure. At $30 I wouldn't make a habit of this, but the rest of the menu was full of yummy options in the $15-$20 range, so I think you could find something for any kind of evening - celebrating or just grabbing a bite. 

The restaurant is on the main floor in an old heritage mansion looking out over the river with a terrasse all strung with fairy lights. The seating is comfortably laid out across a few different cozy rooms with tables for families, and romantic corners by the electric fireplace. I'd go back for sure, in the summer with a plan to enjoy the river and the farms and bike trails and the feeling of being far away from the city where people know your name and care about each other, and the pace of life has something to do with rivers and fields and trees.",2014-03-31,Ormstown,-73.99362359999999,45.1240419,"['Restaurants', 'Canadian (New)']"

4,Prohibition Gastrohouse,"Showed up on a Saturday night around 8pm, and learned that it was a good thing that we only needed a table for 2 because otherwise there would've been quite a wait. But luckily being a small group, we managed to get a small table near the front west side corner which suited us well. 

The interior is a pub meets sports bar cross over, which is a bit different and more casual than the normal gastropub vibe, but still worked. Not sure if it was because it was a Saturday night, but there was a surprising mix of music including Daft Punk, Deadmau5, Justice and other mainstream electro tunes.

The draught beer selection is rather impressive with lots of good local and import selections to choose from. $2.43 Jager shots any time of the day is an interesting value prop as well, but being the driver for the night I was unable to take advantage.

As for the food, well first thing I'll say is that we ordered too much to eat, but 3 of 4 items were deemed successes. We started with the Prosciutto Pio Tosini which is a lovely serving tray filled with prociutto, butter, a loaf of uncut tostini bread, and a pile of nuts which all worked quite well with eachother. Our other started was not such a success. We went with the Redneck Poutine and were quite disappointed by it. The lamb was good but didnt really fit the rest of the flavours, and most importantly the tater tots were a mushy mess in the bottom of the dish. A waste of $12.

The mains however were great. Wer'e talking one of the top 5 pulled pork sandwiches in the city! Not as saucy as I usually prefer but still a perfect balance of flavour with a pretty healthy amount of pork on the bun. I also got to try the Open Face Sloppy Josephine in all of its glory with the stacked pieces of lamb on top of a really thick piece of bread. I really liked it, and feel it redeemed the lamb disappointment of the redneck poutine. For sides, the DF Frites are better than Sweet Potato Frites by a long shot. The sweet potatoe fries seemed a bit too limp and greasy.

The tables are now so close that if people are sitting at the next table.....someone at your table has to get up and move the table so that other people at your table can get out. With baby seats and extra chairs lined up against the wall........this is becoming a dangerous situation.

They have made this worse by assigning waitresses to certain table/sections so that one section can be completely packed and another have almost no one in it.

A small club, by Vegas standards. And it's definitely a good thing... Lavo has the theme of an Italian bath house. Went here on a busy Las Vegas Friday night when DJ SKRATCHY was spinning. He kept the crowd live and moving until past 330am. Played club classics as well as the requisite Top 40 hits and mash-ups. Most def, great times... So as long as he's providing the soundtrack, I'll continue to support the place.

I've also hung out downstairs at the Lavo lounge. Liked it a lot as well. It has a wrap around patio facing the Las Vegas strip and directly across the TI hotel & Casino.

I don't know how else to describe it but I spit it in my napkin so I think gross about covers it. Just trust me and order the waffles.

I've had the southwest burger as well. It comes with green chili's, pepper jack cheese, guacamole and a pretty good chipotle mayo. I don't eat cow so I sub in a turkey burger. It's not the best turkey burger in Vegas but it'll do in a pinch. A little dry but it usually is in comparison to a beef patty.

The service is slow and very consistent. It's always slow. Always. I know this going in though so I don't sweat it.

2,Duke's Grille,"We went there for a meal on a Saturday night. We used to go to Mcduffy's all the time and we figured we mine as well give the new place a shot. We went there for a early meal at around 5pm. We figured by then it shouldn't be that crowded or that busy. 

  For a Saturday night they were understaffed. I think I saw maybe three waitresses there. We waited a good five minutes just to be seated and when we were seated the table hadn't even been cleaned off yet from the last people who sat there. We waited a good three minutes for someone to come by with a rag. It took another five minutes just to get our drink orders taken. I ordered a margarita which I never received but they charged us for it. The majority of our visit there was spent waiting for someone just to take our order. 

 The fellow patrons there were rather shady and a lot of them at 5pm were already stumbling around drunk and dropping drinks seemingly on purpose and to be 'cute'. Of course, since they were understaffed the drunks dropping their drinks made the wait time worse for us and simply getting our food. We did finally get our food order taken and the wait seemed overly long to just get our food. Eventually, we decided that we didn't like the environment and we simply took our food to go. 

  We got our food to go, eventually after another horribly long wait. Once we got home, we were able to try the food. I got the chicken pita with sweet potato fries. It was okay, not great, not bad just okay. My husband got coconut shrimp and he said it was made with way too much coconut.

Finally I had to make noise and then this girl with no personality came out and asked how long I had been waiting, I told her and she was like ok I need to figure out what is wrong with the door because it has a sensor that should let me know when someone opens the door.   I really don't care about the technical difficulties you are having when I didn't even get an apology.  That may have made a difference.  But really, what is she doing here by herself anyway. 

My sandwich on this occasion was still good but the smoothie was soupy.  

I presented the girl with my stamp card and she stated they don't accept or stamp cards anymore, okay.... When did this happen, and is there a replacement rewards card??? No biggy but again the poor service just continued.

I'm quick at ordering.  I look at the menu, see something and BAM! it will be in my stomach, being dissolved by acid, very soon.  This time, though, my god.  I wanted to eat everything.  It all sounded so bomb.  I ended up getting a sandwich with salmon on it.  Can't remember what it's called.

The service isn't the friendliest, but it's certainly not rude or curt.  It's just sort of indifferent which is fine by me.  Hell, in some instances I downright prefer it.  The waitress took our order and gave us our check and filled up my ice tea.  I didn't feel ignored at any point.  That's all I want, man.

OK, the gushy part of the review is over now.

In practical terms, don't expect a haute cuisine experience here, this is an old-school diner style restaurant, just without the indoor seating.  In previous years, the servers used to bring you the food on roller skates, but now you just pick it up yourself at the window.

They serve regular chain restaurant food: hot dogs, fries, hamburgers, poutines, along with a few other options like tuna sandwiches and salmon patties.
As a vegetarian, I appreciate that they offer veggie burgers, veggie hot dogs, and even veggie pogos!  These kind of things are often hit or miss, but at the Orange Julep I've always found the veggie options to be very tasty.

Extra bonus, the poutine gravy is veggie-based!
Admittedly, I find the fries to be rather disappointing, but all I really care about is the cheese (and not eating meat), so I'll settle for the compromise on fry quality.

3,Rachel's Kitchen,"I was struggling with how to describe this place when having lunch here for the first time with coworkers. Eventually I decided that ""bistro"" is the best way to classify this restaurant. A very Summerlin feeling bistro. Hopefully that makes sense for you Vegas residents. If not, then another way to put it is that it's a smaller, bougie version of Panera Bread.

The food was okay. I had the turkey club, which had smoked turkey, bacon, Swiss cheese, avocado, romaine lettuce, tomatoes and mayo served on three pieces of sourdough bread. The portion size was good. I like that I had a choice of mixed green salad, french fries, sweet potato fries or onion rings with my sandwich. Whenever sweet potato fries are an option at a restaurant, I go with that.

Food was a bit pricey. $11 plus tax for a turkey club. Because of that fact, Rachel's Kitchen probably won't join my lunch rotation.

The cashier told me the wait would be 17 minutes (which I was surprised at and wished I'd called ahead) so I walked around the strip mall area a little bit.

After about 10ish minutes, I walked back and my food was ready. I grabbed my cup and made my way to the drink station which was absolutely gross and a mess. I chose sweet tea but they have their tea in a Gold peak dispenser where you press which flavor of tea you want. What came out can best be described as light brown water. NOT GOOD. I threw it all down the sink when I got home.

As for the food, the wings were delicious. Nice, bold flavors and the chicken was nice and crispy. The fries were the winner for me though. Love, love, loved the seasoning and found myself understanding why so many people were asking for seasoning packets at Wingstop.

Anyways- it was off-season in Vegas, so we only waited about 10-minutes before being seated. Because it was brunch, mimosas were complimentary and we were going to get our money's worth. We 

I seriously could list out all the food that I ate, but that would be a super, super long review. If you want to know- you can see the photos I posted while here. Everything was scrumptious!

A couple of standouts:
- Beef brisket: It was smokey, tender and came in a big slab on your plate. You could break apart the meat with your fork with little effort. This one of my favorite things.

- Eggs Benedict with skirt steak: A small individual portion served in a cast iron skillet. The egg yolk was calling my name from across the restaurant. I ate two without any effort, but had to contain myself before going back for a third. They also have this same dish with fried chicken instead. I wanted beef. The meat is tender and has that nice grilled flavor. Break the egg and it's like a slop of heaven soaking into your bottom piece of English muffin.

Quail egg flatbread: This came lathered with small little over-medium eggs and bacon. The outer crust was crispy and you heard that crunch when you broke it apart or took a bite. It definitely had that wood-brick oven taste, though, I'm not sure how it was cooked. 

I am just going to say that you HAVE to eat here at least once. Like a tourist destination, you should make it a PRIORITY. Screw the bodies exhibit, screw the Grand Canyon- you need to go to Caesar's Palace for their Bacchanal Buffet.

I do like B Spot.   It's not really bad.   I was shocked by how much more I liked The Rail. Their burgers are seasoned well, and cooked to the requested temperature.   I got one of the specials of the month (a black and blue burger) and was pleasantly surprised.   Restaurants tend to be a little timid about using cajun seasoning, and that is not the case here.   My husband got the bacon/cheeseburger, and it was great.   Again, properly seasoned, no need to hide the patty under loads of sauce or anything else.   Our daughter had the chicken fingers, which were, again, great.    

Our server (Justin, I think) was awesome.   Even though he was clearly the bartender, who was also serving tables, he had plenty of time to take care of our table.

The dining room is small and slightly noisy when it's packed, but the food more than makes up for that!

We received a basket of chips and each got an individual ramekin of salsa - slightly spicy with a sweet undercurrent - very tasty. The chips were warm. We asked the server whether we should get the guacamole appetizer or the table side guacamole and he said that they are basically the same thing, the only difference is the entertainment when they make it table side, so we should probably get the regular (and less expensive) one for the two of us - huge bonus points for the waiter! The guac was very good!

My wife got the chicken fajitas - not as many onions as she likes but the flavor was on point. So many restaurants try to over-season their fajitas, not the case here. I got the fish tacos. Wow. It's not often you can find an excellent fish taco here in town and this was all that and more! Highly recommend the fish tacos.

5,The Buffet at Bellagio,"Say what you want about buffets, but to me when you are in Vegas, you MUST go to a buffet, at Bellagio that its, worth the price, worth the wait, even though on my most recent trip there was no wait, very surprised. There is constant comparison with this one to the one at Wynn, however this one is by far the best one as far as I know, and I have tried many on the strip. There is a tendency for the more upscale resorts to have the higher quality product and variety for those who are not aware, as I have tried to patronize the cheaper ones, and was not satisfied, you get what you pay for. I go for the ""good stuff"" rack of lamb, prime rib, beef wellington, Kobe beef, seafood items, ceviche, lobster. Why does everyone rave about king crab legs though? those salty and spongy little skinny things with not even alot of meat. I tried a little here a little there though as far as the other items, just for the sake of trying as many things as possible. I tried to stay away from the Japanese section, though as majority of the time, buffets tend not to be quite as authentic as one would expect. The sushi was okay, nothing special, accompanied by a seaweed type salad of some kind. The desserts were one of the best parts of the buffet, as the choices are good. I went for the chocolate eclairs, tiramisu, mini cakes, cones with a chocolate mousse and rasperry, strawberry cake. The desserts were good, nothing was too sweet.

Reservations are easy to make (even on the day of), and the restaurant is great at honoring any requests you may have as far as what type of table you prefer.  My husband and I prefer to sit in a booth along the back wall overlooking the dining room because it is quieter and more intimate than sitting in the main dining room.  Everything on the menu is priced pretty reasonably, especially considering the quality of the food and the prime location of the restaurant.  It may be less expensive to dine here because it's not as flashy or as trendy as other spots, but the quality of the food does not disappoint.

Service was friendly and quick during our meal, and we noticed that there were lots of runners and additional staff moving around to keep the food moving quickly from the sushi bar to your table, and to make sure that your water glass never goes empty.  Before we ordered, our server recommended a few items on the new Robata menu, so we tried them.  The asparagus was outstanding!  One portion is perfect for two adults to share - and the miso topping smothered on top was out of this world delicious!!!  Order it. Trust me!

We also tried a variety of traditional rolls and sashimi, but the yellowtail rolls and sashimi stood out as our favorite.  The menu does not have a huge variety of specialty or unique rolls, but the sushi bar items that they do offer are executed so well you don't miss all of the crazy sauces and toppings.  We also tried sorbet for dessert, and the lychee and coconut flavors were our favorites.  The server told us that all of their sorbets were made with coconut milk, so while they tasted light and refreshing, there was also a bright decadence about them that really filled us up.  I will say that there was more rice on the rolls than I would have preferred, so next time we will look to see if they offer any rolls wrapped without rice, or just request less rice on the rolls we do order.

Overall we really enjoyed Japonais and would definitely recommend it.

2,The Haymaker,I was hoping to have a solid meal here based on the Yelp reviews.  We had 6 different appetizers (Happy Hour) as our meal.  The wings were the only thing I would try again and they were dry this trip.  The ribs had good flavor but were cold and dry.  The pickles seemed to be the only thing house made and they were big spears that didn't go over well.  The bourbon on the happy hour menu I wanted they were out of so the only other options were Jack or Jim.  Can get that anywhere.  Skip the nachos and the cheese fries.  I doubt we will give them a 2nd chance unless it is for b-fast.  A little harder to screw up b-fast!!!

There is just a small amount of smashed avocado on top of the omelet. 

The patio is really nice - as of last weekend, they didn't have umbrellas out there yet, so dress for the heat if you're sitting outside. 

It looks like they have a good happy hour but they only have it available in the bar area - and even when I got there mid-week a little after 5:00, it was already full.

It was raining and cold, and I really did NOT want to go home and cook after a long work day. I called ahead and ordered a serving of won-ton soup to go. I was on hold for a bit (and by hold I mean the phone was set down while they took care of another customer's payment) but they were quick to apologize and reassured that they did not forget me. When I picked up my order, it was ready for me and I didn't have to wait. The young girl at the front was very welcoming and a great conversationalist. From the brief glimpse I saw of the actual restaurant, the staff is extremely welcoming and the it was pretty full on a Monday night, which tells me that the food is good. My won-ton soup was delicious and they were generous with the won tons, chicken, shrimp and veggies. I loved it! I must go back to actually dine in, and to get more won ton soup. Besides my mom's, I would say it was one of the best that I've had.

1,Yamato Hibachi & Sushi Bar,"Is there a worse rating?  Okay, so we were sat with another group (which is very normal), but let's just start this little ditty off by mentioning that they left...  So my kids got their drinks 20 minutes after we sat down, and one was flavorless.  5 minutes later when our beers had not arrived, I walked to the bar and told the manager about the pop being out of syrup, he poured it out in the sink and meandered to the back room.  My beer is still just taunting me from the server station as our waiter stares blankly at a computer screen not even touching it ( a normal part of our dining experience).  After 35 minutes our order was placed, our neighbors now across the street eating tacos, We stared indulgently at the other tables enjoying their food, all the while my kiddo is still waiting for his first drink, I had to approach the waiter who was justifying the problem and sat unwilling to help telling me his manager is confused... Now finally after an hour our chef shows up and proceeded to display a hibachi routine straight out of The Muppets, flailing food around the hibachi in some sort of slapstick comedy routine on Saturday Night Live.  Food was okay, it was a high caliber of Filet and the quality shrimp were undeniable.  Paid our bill with a $50 gift card and our Visa, and after 20+ minutes of folly at the register, we were returned a gift card receipt showing a balance of $6.33 left on the gift card, all the while a charge on the Visa?!?!?!?  While the bottle of Saki that was likely shot down my throat in an hour and a half was a good time, this dude just kinda wanted his steak, ya know?

The place feels family run with a few people hanging out at the tables near the counter anytime you walk in. Speaking of walking in, this isn't the kind of place you really want to eat in at. I mean if you're just grabbing and going, maybe, but my recommendation would be to stick with take-out.

the calzone was quite good but i wish i hadn't gotten the broccoli in it.

the veggieballs (vegan meatballs) are SCRUMPTIOUS. get them. yum.

The angel bites....(marshmallow consistency fluffed fried dough with sugar on top.) lived up to their name. But they need some sort of fruity sauce or sorbet to accompany them to put them over the top.

3,Cabo Wabo Cantina,"After arriving in Vegas off of an early morning flight, we wanted to find a place to grab some quick lunch and where we could enjoy the beautifully hot and sunny weather.  We headed out from our hotel, Aria, and Cabo Wabo's patio fit the bill.  The second floor patio provided nice views of the Bellagio lake,and the misters under the umbrellas were an added bonus!

We started with some guacamole and queso which came with two huge baskets of corn chips.  The guacamole was ok, the cheese was really runny, and the chips were in tiny pieces which make dipping a challenge.

For mains, between us we had the Baja fish tacos, the jalapeno chicken, and the southwest cobb salad.  The chicken was a bit overcooked and dry, but the overall flavour was good and spicy.  The fish tacos featured grilled fish which was also a bit try, and they definitely weren't the best I'd ever had.  The salad looked great, and was a huge portion.

There definitely wasn't any food that would be worth returning for.  The prices were a bit expensive for what we got, particularly the $15 banana mama drink that was not that tasty.  The waiter was attentive, but was well versed in upselling, however not in a pushy way.

4,Marben,"I've been wanting to check out Marben and Bevette for a long time but never seem to get down to Wellington.  I finally went today and I really liked it.

The place looks great.  I love the roof and the careful mish mash of art.  We sat at the back and we had a view of the kitchen which was cool.  At one point they brought out huge pieces of frozen beef - I think they literally had a whole cow right on the counter.  It was kind of weird to see that but whatever...

For the food, they brought out some hearty bread with a nice oil and chili sauce.  For the meal, I had the plat du jour which consisted of pureed carrots, broccoli and I think turnups and the chicken (you order a side and protein separately).  The veggies were really good.  

The service was great - very friendly!

This is one of the better places I've had breakfast... Maybe it was the hype, maybe the wait in the cold rain, or maybe it was just the food.

1,Jaleo,"It was our first experience with Jaleo.

The initial greet with the hostess was great! Super friendly and sat is immediately.

We were greeted by Eric who brought us water and would be right back to take our beverage order. It took exactly 9 minutes for him to return to take our first round. It was frustrating so we decided to order as much as possible.

I ordered the 2 cone of the salmon tartar and asked if there was any onions. He said there were shallots but would ask if it could be omitted. He never er came back!!! The salmon came out before our wine? I guess timing was off. We then wanted the paella but were limited to two options reasoning they like to circulate the menu. Ok? I'm def not ordering the vegetable paella!!! 

Anyways it got even worse!!! We order the clam dish 15 minutes prior to suffice for the paella. Eric then comes by to inform us they are out of it 15 minutes after ordering!!! I'm in to food industry and I'm pretty sure their time standard for a clam dish is less than 15 minutes! I was just over it at this point. I asked for the check hungry and aggregated. Thank god the cosmopolitan had many other food options.

4,The Cutting Board,"A very good first time experience at The Cutting Board. Considered going before but seemed they were a little slow getting off the ground. I will definitely go back. Aurora really needs more good dining options, so I wish them well. 

Went at lunch time and was impressed with the right mix of creativity in the menu options without being too far out of the mainstream. Really enjoyed the food. Ordered the Buttermilk Chicken Sandwich with Bourbon Slaw and side salad with the Honey Scallion dressing (a no charge substitute for fries). I truly enjoyed the meal. They make things from scratch here, not reheating frozen like so many of the chains do today. For that reason, I don't agree with others that say they are overpriced. I found pricing to be spot on for the value delivered. 

The waitress was also very friendly, informative and attentive which topped off the experience. 

They have Breakfast, Lunch and Dinner menus so need to go back and try the others. I don't write many reviews and rarely give 5 stars to anything, but if they go 2 for 2 with me, they have a shot.

3,The Captain's Boil,"First timer... wouldn't say I would frequent much as it gets messy. We tried pretty much every seafood menu item offered. Don't get the shrimp appetizer just frozen shrimp. Large portion but not fresh seafood. Loved the whole crab I would go back and order a bunch of these. 
Mussels not that great they are the green muscles so they are most likely frozen. I would never order this again. 
Fresh shrimps not that great either, mushy 
Dungeness Crab and clams I would recommend. 
I wonder if they cook all the food in the plastic bags? Not very safe if they do. Boiling food in plastic bags... hmmmmm... 
Not much on service as they just drop bags off at ur table and don't really check on you. 
If your looking for an experience eat here you'll get messy and you will always remember eating here. It's like when your deciding on a family outing... 
take them here.

Not an environmentally friendly restaurant. 
Everything they use in there goes straight to the trash, cups only plastic not even glass cups for a beer lol 
Plastic cutlery if u ask and plastic bags upon plastic bags.

When they charge so much for dinner it would have been wonderful if they also brought a salad to our table.

Then they brought out ALL of the meats. Way too much.   By the time you're served the meats almost every piece was at best room temperature. It was also difficult to get your meat rare.

3,T.C. Eggington's,"The wait for two people was about a half an hour. They had coffee labled water containers out front for people to stay hydrated which I guess the thought is what counts, but to my boyfriend's disappointment it was not actually coffee. It's a small quaint 'family-owner' styled restaurant. It was fairly neat and clean. However, they need a course for their wait staff to learn what constitutes unmotivated service to excellent service. They need two bussers just to clean off one table fast enough. The waiters all seem to go at their own morning pace and the professionality just is not there (yet they have potential). I feel that there is great possibilities for this place to become a staple in the east side of towns must-have breakfast locations.

I think the benchmark of a good sushi/sashimi restaurant is how they make their chirashi don (or an inside out sushi burrito"". Ninki truly meets that test as their salmon and salmon chunks (covered with a delicious mayo sauce) is really fresh and tender. The tuna actually does melt in your mouth and is complemented by sesame on a bed of rice. Ninki knows how to get it done.

What makes it enigmatic is how damn good it is... Too good for Chandler and maybe too good for the valley.

The portions are just right, and anybody that tells you otherwise is a fat ass or a glutton (I'm 6'3, 200lbs. and I was satisfied).  If you want large portions though, go to their lunch/brunches.  I've been there twice and had The Lamb Chop, which was amazing on all levels, and I've had some serious lamb in rural Bosnia, which has been labeled the best in their country... sure enough cork's stood up blow for blow.  The other entrée I experienced was the buttermilk fried chicken.  I was so amazed by the lamb the first time, that I had to try something more ""simple"" in order to qualify their food in regards to regular places.  Let's just say the chicken was not regular, it was outstanding.  The appetizers are crazy good... can anyone say king crab legs?

The wine selection is top notch.  the booze selection is killin, and they even make this amazing Italian lemon stuff that's like 90% alcohol.  make sure you have a designated driver, because this place will inspire winos and boozers to indulge to their fullest.

3,The Old Spaghetti Factory,"The Old Spaghetti Factory has been a family staple for many years.  We used to love coming here with our kids for a good time, great portions of pasta and a unique, antique and relaxed atmosphere.  While some menu items have changed, we still enjoy the white clam sauce (which, I'm the first to admit is like a white clam gravy), the kids' meals are fantastic and the mizithra with browned butter is still a dish that speaks for itself.  The pasta is al dente and the bread is hot and fresh.  

However, over the years the service has gone downhill.  We have avoided our favorite place because of the long drive, and found the price just wasn't worth the trip anymore.  Last week, we chanced it again.  The wait was moderate and the drinks were strong (and surprisingly so!).  The food was very good and the waitstaff was on their game.

BUT - the lobby.  Oh, the glorious lobby which used to be filled with large antique furniture, including an old-fashioned sled the people could sit in to wait.  The ""Spaghetti Tree"" was leafy and dusted and nice - not so much this time.  The lobby is in very ill-repair.  It is no longer inviting - it is, instead, rundown and depressing.  Kids run rampant and why not?  It no longer looks like a place where one should sit nicely and wait for a table.  The Spaghetti Tree is showing its age, with layers of dust and missing leaves, and the ""pasta case"" is still filled with the same noodles that have been inside of it for years. 

It is way past time for the owners to take the time and spend the money to fix up the lobby and restore it to its days of glory.  No, this is not a new restaurant.  Yes, it still needs a spit and polish to make it really shine.  This is one chain that has never felt like a chain, and in order to stay open with all of the new businesses in the area, it is more than time for a revamp.

Old Spaghetti Factory, we have given you a second chance.  Its time that you invited us back by showing that you too, care about your restaurant.",2014-03-26,Phoenix,-112.07415300000001,33.46425,"['Restaurants', 'Italian']"

4,Gallagher's Steakhouse,"This was kind of a bailout dinner choice for us since we have been here before and we usually try new places each time we come to LV, but we weren't in the mood to take a taxi anywhere or walk around and also wanted to be close to the Cirque theater since we had tickets for that night.   Gallagher's was definitely the best option at NYNY so we didn't mind at all.

Dry aged beef lines the front of the restaurant, enticing the naive passerby to come check out their selection of prime cut steaks and chops.  Vintage pictures of stars and athletes line every bit of wall space that the moderate sized restaurant has to offer.  The relatively low ceilings and minimal windows create the appearance of a classic New York style supper house.  

We arrived a few minutes before our reservation so I decided to jump on the shoe shining seat and have a good old fashioned hand shoe shine.  He made quick work on my shoes and I walked off with a seemingly brand new pair of kicks.  We walked in and it was surprisingly pretty crowded for a Sunday night.  We sat down near the rear of the back room, which sounds bad but it's actually pretty nice and quiet there and also it was near the door that leads to the restroom in the hall so it turned out to be a good spot.  

Our server quickly greeted us and brought water and bread to our table.  We were torn on entrees and she was very eager to offer up some suggestions from her personal picks.  We agreed on the Ribeye and Rack of Lamb with sides of jalapeno mash and mushroom medley.  We also ordered the Crab Cocktail to start us off along with a bottle of a nice Chilean Red.

Crab Cocktail - Basically 3 sections of King Crab served with lemon and cocktail sauce.  No work necessary since it was sliced in half lengthwise for us.  Delicious.

Mushroom Medley - Great earthy side.  Not much to this so order if you love mushrooms.

Jalapeno Mashed Potatoes - Cheesy potatoes with a slight kick (very slight)   Salted perfectly and not too much cheese.  

Ribeye - For me, a ribeye is a ribeye so unless you overcook it, the only thing left is the size of the cut and this cut was huge.  Served on the bone, this is not for the feint of heart.

Rack of Lamb - The star of the show.  Served medium rare is the key to perfection.  Basic seasonings along with a good sear makes lamb one of the best cuts around.  No different here.  Soooo good.  None of that mint jelly mess or paper booties needed.

We had lots of leftovers so we took some to our room to store in ice.  We also took some olive bread as well.  Great leftover lunch the next day.

We had a great meal here for a not-so-expensive price tag.  It was really good.  We would like to try some other cuts the next time we happen to be around here.

Oh, and there's a lady that walks around taking pictures if you would like.  She comes back with like sets of pictures that she prints out and places in photo folders.  I felt like it was high school grad or prom or something.   We got to choose 8x10 or 5x7 or wallet size.  Lol.   We ended getting just one picture in 8x10.  Felt bad but she shouldn't have printed them all out without asking what we wanted first.  For better profit margin, get a digital photo frame and show all the pictures to the customer so save money on ink and paper.  Nothing wasted except battery life.

I recommend ordering a mezze sampler, which has all of the classic Lebanese goodies (tabbouleh, falafel, hummus, etc) made to perfection. However, you must not leave without trying the sleek!

4,Steelz,"My friend had suggested going here after reading about it in City Life. In recent years, this area has become desolate, but it is promising to see some new establishments opening up.

The menu consists of bar friendly food with splashes of more intricate items. One point that will be raised often is the fact that their burgers do not come with fries. Those need to be ordered on their own. For a burger and fries, it will cost around $15. It is not uncommon now a days, but people will still complain. We had ordered a plate of the Spicy Harissa Fries and they were wonderful. Oily, but the curry type flavor was nice. I had ordered the Grilled Vegetable Salad. A full portion of salad greens were tossed in a generous amount of balsamic vinaigrette then topped with asparagus, zucchini, squash, eggplant, peppers, avocado, and pita bread. I am the type that will go to a bar and eat a salad. Would I order this again? Yes, just ask for light dressing or on the side. My friend's Brie Angus Burger was mouthwatering good. I could not resist stealing a bite. The juicy beef patty is topped with grilled onions, brie cheese, mixed greens, and would normally come with bacon and grilled peppers. He asked for it without bacon, but the peppers were missing as well. The burger does come with a small side salad. There were little issues with our meal, but the friendliness of our server/owner(?) more than made up for it. He kept our drinks constantly filled and made polite chit chat throughout. 

They have a nice happy hour that would be worth checking out. Although the drinks might not be as cheap as other places, the food sounds enticing. From 4pm-7pm, they have drinks and food. From11pm-2am, they only have drinks because the kitchen closes down. Both HH are seven days a week as well. Flat bread pizza was the recommended special to take advantage of.",2011-10-23,Henderson,-115.0773405,36.0704394,"['American (New)', 'Restaurants']"
3,Coffee Culture,"They have a nice patio and comfy couches.  However, Wi-Fi is iffy and it is hard to tell which is their network. The cashier told me it was ""cafe 1220"", there was also a a ""cafe 1220 media"", and two other networks that started with ""coffee culture"". Not a big deal, since I have a data plan and can use my own personal hotspot, but I am with Wind, so my data is kind of slow.  

Anywho, the cafe itself is pretty nice and there's a big booth that can fit around 8 people, which would be good for group gatherings and a small patio.  While the patio is nice, it looks onto the street, so not the most appealing unless you want to breathe car fumes.  Ah, the joys of living in the suburbs.  As for the food itself, I ordered an Asiago bagel sandwich.  The bagel itself was pretty good as it was panini pressed, but the problem is with the content of the sandwich.  The bacon was average, but the egg was terrible.  It tasted like those horrible Subway eggs, which are pre-cooked, frozen, then put into the oven again.  2/5 for the sandwich.

3,The Bier Markt,"Came here without reservations on a Friday night around 6pm. I think I came at a good time, because we didn't have to wait too long for a patio table for 2. The waitress who served us (unfortunately, I don't remember her name) was enthusiastic, attentive (but not overly so), and knowledgable about her beers. 

To start, we had the gouda bombs ($12), and I had the provencale mussels and frites ($22). Gouda bombs were okay - can't really go wrong with fried cheese and fancy ketchup. The cheese bites were fried nicely, but I felt that the price is a little steep for the portion size. The mussels, on the other hand, came in a very generous portion; I could only finish half before I had to surrender the rest to my dinner companion. The fries were nicely done, and came with 3 sauces; ketchup, curry mayo, and horseradish mayo. This entree also came with a crusty rosemary bread. 

TLDR; 7/10. I would come back, but next time I'm in the area, I'd rather try something else.",2015-05-02,Toronto,-79.40000529999999,43.6448594,"['Beer', 'Wine & Spirits', 'Belgian', 'Restaurants', 'Food', 'Canadian (New)', 'Bars', 'Gastropubs', 'Nightlife']"

The wine selection is nice and we started with a reasonably priced Aime Cabernet Franc and had a lighter fruity Oregon Pinot Noir with the entrees.  We sampled Baked Brie with a flaky crust and dried fruits, a salad with cashews, fruits and goat cheese, peppers stuffed with andouille sausage, yummy sea bass with tomatoes ,asparagus and a delectable lemony Beurre Blanc, the duck confit tartine, and for dessert, Lemon Creme Brulee and bread pudding.

5,KINTON RAMEN,"A couple of my friends and coworkers were going to try Kinton's Mega Ramen challenge, so I decided to tag along and watch the action.
The place is nicely designed with a casual and upbeat atmosphere you would expect at a izakaya restaurant, complete with a Japanese staff that welcomes you a jovial traditional Japanese cheer of a greeting. The kitchen is wide open in the middle of the restaurant where you can watch them assemble the ramen bowls. The place is rather hot and humid, which you would expect when the restaurant is constantly pumping out bowls of ramen.
The music playing there was a medley of pop song covers in a Japanese karaoke style, it was a tad on the loud side but was really cheeky and fun to listen to.

On a cold night, a hot bowl of ramen in a creamy broth is definitely a perfect comforting meal, however the Mega Ramen bowl is another story:

The Mega Ramen bowl consists of a large bowl of ramen with 2 extra servings of noodles, topped with 6 pieces of pork shoulder, 4 pieces of pork belly, 1 seasoned egg, a sheet of nori and 3 servings of beansprouts. It was one big-ass towering bowl of ramen! It costs $30, but the challenge is to consume the entire bowl including the broth in less than 15 minutes and it's free with your name on their wall of fame and bragging rights.  You will need to sign a waiver before embarking on this challenge. 

When I was there were about 10 other people doing the Mega Ramen challenge, and it was definitely a very entertaining scene, with many people going over to other tables to watch and cheer on people struggling trying to down the massive mountain of ramen with some taking photos in awe.

Meanwhile back to my meal: 
I started off with the fried chicken starter, which was a basket of nuggets of whole chicken meat which was lightly dusted in flour and fried and served with a Japanse mayo. It was so tender, juicy and delicious especially with a squeeze of lemon and a healthy dunk of mayo. I highly suggest ordering this.
The menu had a great selection of ramen bowls, with various choices of broth, meats and optional toppings, so you can customize your ramen to your liking. I had the Shoyu ramen with chicken soy broth and pork shoulder and I added jalapeno paste for an added spicy kick. It was a great combination. I love the mellow and mildly spicy broth and the slices of pork shoulder were tender and had a slightly smoky taste -- the pieces of pork were lightly flamed with a blow torch before it went into the ramen. The chicken broth had crumbles of chicken meat which added a nice texture to the broth base. I really like the seasoned egg which was perfectly boiled with a soft creamy yolk.
I don't normally finish all of the broth in a ramen bowl, but I did this time not only because it was tasty but also to get your photo taken with your empty bowl and with your own comments featured on their Instagram page. You also get a stamp on their frequent ""bowler"" card for various rewards.

My friends didn't finish their Mega bowl in the 15 minutes, they didn't even finish half of it, but they could take the rest home to enjoy for later -- they were literally sweating from the mass consumption. There were four Japanese guys at the bar next to us who all did the Mega bowl and were so entertaining to watch. A couple of them came close and it was funny to see them leave the restaurant looking wheezy and taking a rest and a smoke on the bench outside. They were amazing sports and were happy to have their pictures taken even though looked like he was about to throw up. 
There were about half a dozen of people on the wall of fame which many of them finishing at just under 15 minutes with the leader clocking in at an unbelievable 9 minutes!

I myself would rather enjoy my ramen at my own pace. Even though I had the regular size

The food is tasty and reasonably priced, and the atmosphere is fun. It's comforting and will lift your spirits at the same time. I will definitely make use of my Bowler card!",2014-01-09,Toronto,-79.4163258,43.6640864,"['Ramen', 'Japanese', 'Restaurants']"

3,Lao Sze Chuan,"*** Review is for Restaurant Week 2015 menu ***

Restaurant Week gave me the push to try Lao Sze Chuan.  I probably wouldn't have stopped here but for their being on the Restaurant Week list.   Their menu actually is four courses and they have flexibility with their offering.

After asking for the Restaurant Week menu, the server brought it to me and explained that I could mix both the appetizers and the mains with smaller portions so you could try more.  Instead of getting three pot stickers, I was able to order 1 Shanghai egg roll, 1 chicken egg roll, and 1 pork pot sticker.  For the main course, I was allowed to get half portions of any two dishes so I ordered the three chili chicken and the lemon shrimp.  I opted for the hot and sour soup and for dessert I ordered the coconut ice cream.

My iced tea was brought quickly and I took the time to enjoy the beautiful room.  It is very nice.  Soon a gentleman brought my hot and sour soup.  When I was halfway through the soup, my server brought me the appetizer.  I just don't understand this lack of serving separate courses that I've experienced in Asian restaurants--twice during this Restaurant Week period.  The hot and sour soup was very good and I wish I had some time to savor the flavors after finishing before having to dig into the appetizer.  The egg rolls were OK.  The pot sticker was a bit of a letdown.  One side was not completely done and had a doughy taste.  With the appetizer I got soy, hot mustard, and sweet and sour sauce.  

The main courses were large servings.  A full serving would be a large amount of food for sure.  The lemon shrimp was very good and consisted of 11 shrimp if I counted correctly.  The three chili chicken was good but it wasn't as spicy as I like.  What kick there was came from cracked pepper in the batter and hot sesame oil.  The plate had a lot of oil from the chicken.  

The coconut ice cream was very good and a nice way to end the meal.  The ice cream not only had a coconut flavor but also had toasted coconut flakes mixed throughout.  Very refreshing.

The service was a mixed bag here.  My server, Rachel, was quite good.  She brought me a fresh iced tea when my first one was only half finished.  She was very pleasant, had a great smile, and if she had been doing all the serving, I have a feeling the soup and the apps wouldn't have overlapped.

This could be a four star place.  I'd recommend they watch the courses and space them out a bit more.  I was in and out of the restaurant in just over 45 minutes.  Give me a little more time to savor the separate parts of the meal.",2015-06-23,Las Vegas,-115.19568400000001,36.114539,"['Chinese', 'Asian Fusion', 'Szechuan', 'Restaurants']"

Any main breakfast staple you can think of is on the menu, so if it's cookable, they've got it.

While they do have a good amount of seating, most people order take out. Either way, it's quick & you'll get in & out without much of a hassle.

3,Carbone,"Time machines cost money.

NYC's Carbone makes it to Aria.  Serving I-talian (Americanized Italian food) with 1960's panache.  Maroon jacket clad ""table captains"", table side preparations, Sinatra playing overhead, and a stunning dining room to match.  Unfortunately, the journey to yesteryear is gonna cost you.  Prices are out of line surpassing its NYC location.

Incorrect preconception that I-talian is unpretentious and fun perhaps but $6 golf ball size meatball, $27 handful of pasta with tomato sauce, $65 veal parm, $200 porterhouse steak for two?  You draw your own conclusions.

Tip:  if you want to eat family style, ask the table captain to make recommendations.  Certain dishes are large and can be shared.  

About the food, the meatball is just OK. Tender and juicy braised in a flavorful sauce but lacking seasoning.  It relies on the sauce to flavor it. 

Prosciutto and Mozz solid.  Mild, thinly sliced prosciutto and hand pulled, mildly seasoned mozzarella with torn basil, EVOO and fresh cracked pepper, a pleasing finger starter.  The carpaccio, acceptable.  Thin slice of chilled beef topped with a EVOO and marinated mushrooms.  While pleasing, both dishes lacked intensity and a wow factor.  Even the EVOO lacks any kind of intensity (black pepper notes, bitterness, acidic grip).

Veal dishes are well made.  The marsala and parmesan both nice cuts, perfectly cooked, tender and milky.  The marsala properly cooked off and imparting a great woody flavor, the acidic tomato sauce on the veal parm, improving the natural sweetness of the veal.

The standout dish was the surprisingly simple spicy rigatoni.  Perfectly cooked, giant rigatoni enveloped in a tomato vodka sauce.  It's spicy but the flavor of the chili shows through and is well balanced by the gently acidic tomato sauce.  Austere and a joy to eat.

Service borders on slow even by European standards.

Good wine list focusing on Italy.  High Vegas resort markup.

The sushi was awful. Were talking rice, seaweed paper, some avocado and maybe some fake crab here and there.

The dessert they got right, but only the ice cream. Kinda hard to mess that up.

THis was the only restaurant that I had HALF a plate the entire time at a buffet. Im a fiend for Mandarin, but this place just turned me off completely. Even the roast beef was overcooked, and the mashed potatoes were completely flavourless. Everything tasted bad, it was like being stuck in a dennys all day.........The won ton soup was cold and the won tons were almost all unravelled in the soup stock, meaning it was sitting there for hours on end, and when I did taste it, it was almost completely flavourless too.

Avoid like the plague. No effort or service goes into this place, its there to lure white people in for ""authentic"" south asian cuisine.

The galleria supermarket next door serves better food in its hot plate section.

The service was almost non-existant. We'd wait 20 - 30 minutes for refills, and staff had almost no understanding or command of the english language, and were almost entirely brand new to Canada from Korea or China. Language barriers when patrons are hungry just fuel the fire of frustration and anger, and it shows here. Poor planning, crappy food choices, and awful service. We waited another 20 minutes for the bill, and have to pay up front for some reason, no table service. Completely stupid service strategy here..........you treat your patrons like dine and dash criminals and make them pay before they leave like welfare cases.

I'll never eat here again. Garbage. Anyone giving this place more than 1 star is almost completely insane or got the staff on a good day. Either way, dont waste your money here.",2012-11-17,Toronto,-79.34989200000001,43.755169,"['Buffets', 'Restaurants', 'Chinese']"
4,The Buffet at ARIA,"My boyfriend and I really liked this place that we ate here two days in a row during brunch. Brunch over the weekends cost around $30.

On the first day we ate here, we got here just before dinnertime but only paid for brunch and was able to enjoy some of the dinner foods they brought out.
I was really craving some meat that day and got the prime rib. I was hugely disappointed to find that it was tough, overcooked and dry. 
My favorite item was the smoked salmon. 
The chicken sausage was also great; the frittata that comes in the mini cast iron skillet was okay but a bit salty. The mashed potato was plain. The eel sushi was good. My boyfriend was a huge fan of the crab legs. 
I didn't try any dessert due to a gluten allergy but my boyfriend liked the pistachio gelato.
When dinner came around, we heard that they had lamb leg and I got a piece of that and was disappointed yet again; it too was tough, overcooked and dry.
I also got some raw oysters which were pretty good. 

The next day, the line was longer when we got there but it still moved relatively fast. I tried their scrambled eggs which were bomb-diggity. I got some more smoked salmon of course, as well as the chicken sausage. They also had some cooked veggies (zucchini, yellow squash and carrots) which were great. I tried one of their proscuitto and it tasted horrible. I think I remember telling my boyfriend it tasted like soap. It was so bad that I spit it out into a napkin. Again, no dessert for me but my boyfriend liked the creme brulee. 

Overall I really liked this buffet. One star docked off because of the disappointing meat and most of the items were okay, not great. But I'd still come back here if I'm ever back in Vegas.",2013-01-30,Las Vegas,-115.17698,36.107406,"['Buffets', 'Restaurants']"

4,Los Taquitos,"One of my favorite local places for tacos. Like alot of people I found this after watching them on diners drive ins dives.  It's got a totally different vibe since the remodel and I love it!Food still has the authentic homemade taste you just couldn't call it a dive anymore. The service staff is always friendly and helpful. They did keep the original yellow benches but when they expanded they added quite a few tables in between. One wall now has flat screen tvs, new lighting and modern music. Food wise I like the AL pastor the best then the Carne asada or chicken. Depending on how hungry I am either getting tacos or burritos. It's rare I dont leave here without getting a horchata. It's fun to munch on the pickled veggies while waiting and both homemade salsa have unique flavors. I get my burritos with the spicy bombero sauce but it's not for everybody....

5,Mama Gina's Pizzeria,"I don't get out to the far West side very often. In fact, it had been so long that I didn't even know all that Westgate stuff was even there. Imagine my surprise! I have been to a few games at the stadium, but all of the shopping and restaurants were new to me. It's absolutely beautiful here. 

It was also nearly deserted when I went today - no games going on. There's not much else out here. Just this giant oasis of awesome in the middle of a corn field. 

I've glazed over the other reviews here and I almost didn't get it at first. I mean, such polarized opinions about a pizza place. Walking around Westgate and seeing Mama Gina's, I get it now. Mama Gina's is a nice medium sized restaurant/bar. It's really clean and decorated well. The seating is comfortable and everything is new. Also - it smells like pizza - as a pizza place should.

There's a lovely patio with a giant glass door that I imagine can be opened when weather permits to have an indoor/outdoor atmosphere. There are big flatscreens playing whatever sports is on. They appear to have a full bar as well. 

I ate a slice and took a pie home. Their pizza is pretty unique. It's very flavorful and good. I could tell that their dough was made fresh daily - it was soft and airy. They clearly use quality ingredients. It's a huge cut above a cheapie chain. While waiting, I saw some other food pass by on the way to their respective tables... everything looked pretty amazing and delicious. 

A group was leaving before me and an older man said ""thanks"" to the manager. Then he added that he hadn't had pizza like that since he was a kid and that it was the best pizza he had eaten in years. It was a sincere compliment.

A slice and a soda set me back less than 5 bucks, and the slice was huge enough to fill me up. The pie I took home was as good as the slice I had. This is the kind of pizza you re-heat in the oven rather than the microwave. 

Now the problems - well, there's really only one and all other perceived problems stem from it... it's the location. Because it's next to the stadium and little else, it's either going to be super busy or relatively empty. Because of this, service isn't going to be as consistent - you're just going to have to develop a little patience. Also - most customers coming to this sort of place when busy are the ""I'm drunk and happy my team won"" or ""I'm drunk and pissed my team lost"" types - neither of which are a treat to serve when most of the time you're used to things being fairly calm. 

I recommend eating here when there's not a game (or even when there is - just be patient - same with all the restaurants in Westgate) - the food is worth a bit of a drive, and Westgate is a beautiful commerce center.",2012-01-14,Glendale,-112.2606246,33.534525099999996,"['Pizza', 'Restaurants', 'Italian']"

1,Raising Cane's,"This place is a new kind of pathetic low for the fast food industry. My family and I went last night (11/24/14) to pick up a quick dinner for my brother only. We were all blown away by the incompetence of the staff AND management. We walked in, and promptly ordered a simple chicken sandwich for my brother. That's all. We then took a seat in their waiting area by the register and proceeded to watch the cashier gal (didn't catch her name, she wasn't wearing a nametag either) goof off with her co-workers and kitchen staff for a solid 15 minutes (it was not busy at all; we were the only ones in line at the time). 

In those minutes, we watched our simple order be sent back to the kitchen THREE times for whatever reason (I don't even want to know). We then watched an employee place his order after us and receive his order before us. And finally, while being annoyed by the LOUD cashier girl goof around with her co-workers, we watched a presumable MANAGER actually see them goofing around and disregard it completely.

By this point, we were about ready to ask for a refund and leave, but we finally got our order after waiting 15 minutes. After that, the rest of my family decided to eat at the Wendy's across the street, where our large order was completed in under 5 minutes. WENDY'S has a much more competent staff than this place.

The food was good according to my brother, but not worth waiting for while employees played butt-grab with each other for 15 minutes.

Will not be coming back. Would not recommend this place to anyone.",2014-11-25,Phoenix,-111.98643030000001,33.600226299999996,"['Fast Food', 'Chicken Wings', 'Chicken Shop', 'American (Traditional)', 'Restaurants']"
2,Saigon Kitchen,"Update review... Just went here on a busy Friday and became not a fan...

I did order my norm, combo plate.  Pork cube, pork chop, and shrimp.  Note I always ask to replace the shrimp with chicken.  I cannot eat shellfish and I assume chicken is less than shrimp.  To my surprise they wanted to up charge for the swap?  The waiter said he would have to talk to the manager to do the swap with no up charge.  
I also noted the manager talking up charge to another customer that wanted to substitute the noodles for another type of noodle.  
To top of the experience, another group of customers asked for a bus boy to clean their table.  After waiting for a good 10 minutes they left?  
Maybe they were having a bad night of service?  Another issue I had was once I did get my main course I was not given a steak knife to cut the pork chop on the plate.  Once I did flag down someone, I was told that they had to grab a knife from the kitchen and had no steak knifes and the normal knifes cannot cut the pork chop?
I have put Saigon kitchen on the bottom of places I would visit now that I have experienced poor service on this visit.  Not only me, but it was noted around me and it is not often I am at a restaurant and customers leave because of lack of attention.  
Fix the customer service, up charge, and get some knifes to cut what you serve.  Wish the owners were there.

4,Bad Daddy's Burger Bar,"Love me some Bad Daddy's! 

The homemade chips are one of the items that keeps me coming back and looking forward to having a lunch meeting at either Charlotte location. 

The burgers/sandwiches are great. Nice portion of beef or other sandwich-friendly insides. Not your run-of-the-mill burger. Definitely some of the better combinations out there. The Mama Ricotta burger is awesome and different and the Cantina 1511 is a knockout. Love green chilies on a burger!

The wings fit well on the ""expected"" side when it comes to flavor. Nothing groundbreaking. Also, a little disappointed that you can't order an entree-sized portion. They only come in a 7-8 count as an app. Kinda lame. What if I wanted 15? Too bad, brosef. 

The only downside is their veggie burger. Not a huge fan of the texture. It's a little mealy and tends to fall apart. Definitely had better.

The milkshakes are bangin. Aaaaand you can get it SPIKED! So good. I had never tried a spiked milkshake, let alone heard of one, until I had gone to Bad Daddy's. Seriously worth a try. Better off splitting one of these bad boys (pun intended). It comes with some extra in the spin cup for your further sugar/dairy laden enjoyment. 

Outdoor seating is phenomenal.

4,Mesa Grill,"Mesa Grill is Chef Bobby Flay's restaurant for those who did not know this.  It is located inside of Caesars Palace.  I've watched Bobby Flay cook on TV and the food always looked good, so out of curiosity, I wanted to actually try out his food.  He tends to favor Southwestern and Cajun style dishes.  

My bf and I were immediately seated during lunch time.  The place was surprisingly not busy at all and there were many empty tables.  Our waitress came by and gave us menu and took our drink orders.  She was very attentive and knowledgeable.  She recommended the Tiger Shrimp + Roasted Garlic Corn Tamale, the Ancho Chile-Honey Glazed Salmon, and the Smoked Shrimp Taco.  She said that these were their best sellers.  After looking over Yelp for some recommendations, we decided to go with what the waitress recommended.

Next, she delivered bread and butter to the table.  There were three different kinds of breads and each one had a different flavor, but they were all pretty good.  Don't eat too much of it though otherwise you will be too full when the real meal comes.

When our Tiger Shrimp + Roasted Garlic Corn Tamale came, it was presented beautifully and had corn kernels and a tasty creamy cilantro sauce.  This dish was delicious and I liked how it was seasoned perfectly.  It wasn't bland and the flavoring was not overwhelming either.  It was just right.  The only downside for me was the price of the appetizer which was $19!  I thought that was pretty expensive for a fairly small portion.

The Smoked Shrimp Tacos came with red cabbage slaw, grilled tortillas, avocado, tomatillo & mango salsas.  My bf really enjoyed the tacos and thought they were delicious!  The dish only came with two tacos though and the dish was for $25.

My Ancho Chile-Honey Glazed Salmon came with a spicy black bean sauce, tomatillos, and a roasted jalapeno creama.  My salmon was cooked to perfection.  For someone who hates beans, the dish was very good and all of the ingredients went really well together.  This dish too was $25.

Overall, our service was excellent and our food was really good!  I would highly recommend trying out the dishes that we had ordered.  However, the prices of the food is kind of expensive for small portions.  If you have the funds to try Mesa Grill, I'd highly recommend it.

5,Rolling in Dough Cafe,"In the months following its opening early this year, I have heard nothing but good things about Chocolate & Spice, and have since then been on the edge of my seat to try it out. The elegant decor was the first thing that caught my eye and the classy touch to its color scheme had me peering inside every time I passed by for church at St. Joseph Husband of Mary. 

Today, I finally got a chance to try the bakery out with a galpal and soon after I got in, almost immediately hopped to check out the cute little creative goodies. There were truffles that started at $1.50 each and pastries (including creme brulee and this nutella cake bomb thingamagigy) that cost about $3.75, both excluding tax. Be ready to indulge yourselves in some high quality sweets but don't forget to pan your gaze to the right of the bakery wall where the menu items are listed in colorful chalk. Why? Because they actually have lunch/breakfast specials that range between $6-8. My friend ordered braised chicken with vegetables and aromatic rice while I got a pastrami panini with fontina cheese, caramelized onions and cranberry. Both orders were classic, savory & tasteful, and if you're especially hungry, opt for the latter because its size is merely an illusion to how filling it actually is. 

I found myself spacing out a number of times to the aesthetic atmosphere the bakery brought. It had some familiar, classy tunes playing in the background and I found it adorable how everything was neatly arranged, from the napkins to the water dispenser (which had oranges in it!), to the artistic couches and beautiful displays. Even the Christmas tree and bathroom were color schemed to the familiar purple, green and brown flowery swirls.

2,Real Sports Bar & Grill,"Went with a group to watch the game. The place is a nice upscale sports bar - loud music or the play by play make conversation difficult, but you're here to watch the game after all. They have the biggest screen in Toronto among the many TVs around the place. Decent selection of drinks to ease the pain of watching a Leaf's game. Washrooms are clean and spacious, plenty of tables if you book ahead,  like I said, a nice place to watch the game.
The only problem,  and it's a big one,  is the food. Even by downtown Toronto standards the food is way overpriced. Every one in the group had the same complaint - the ratio of price to portion size and quality is too high.
And this place is a hospital trip in the making for celiacs. It's like they went out of their way to make sure everything has gluten in it. The frozen fries,  the steaks,  even the salad dressings are made with gluten. And when I asked about just getting a plain steak,  the waitress said that the kitchen didn't handle special orders well so I should maybe have a salad without dressing instead. That's reassuring - just have rabbit food and don't bug me.
So, moral of the story is: nice place to watch the game and have a drink, but make sure you eat before you go there. And celiacs are definitely not welcome.",2015-03-19,Toronto,-79.38021967739999,43.6429076363,"['American (New)', 'Bars', 'Restaurants', 'Sports Bars', 'Nightlife', 'Canadian (New)']"

My bill was $20 with two appetizers(that filled this 6'2 300lb athlete up) and two beers.,2016-08-03,Las Vegas,-115.13931044700001,36.167285394400004,"['Restaurants', 'Wine Bars', 'Vegetarian', 'Live/Raw Food', 'Nightlife', 'Vegan', 'Bars']"
4,Smoque N' Bones,"I visited on a Wednesday night.  The food was delicious and tasteful. I ordered the sampler for two, which is way more food than for two. You get a choice of 3 meats and 3 sides.  We chose the peppercorn beef ribs& chicken with Mac & cheese coleslaw and waffle sweet potato fries. 

My top fav were the mac & cheese and the ribs the only thing I didn't care for was the waffle sweet potato fries.

I would of gave five stars but the air conditioning want working and it was extremely hot in there I was dripping with sweat. It was quite uncomfortable.",2016-09-09,Toronto,-79.41157790000001,43.6456599,"['Barbeque', 'Restaurants', 'Comfort Food', 'American (Traditional)']"
2,Pei Wei,"I hate to give this place 2 stars because I truly love the food!  But they were severely under staffed and it created a horrible experience. Management needs to learn to manage and staff accordingly. 

We arrived and the place was overwhelmingly packed the line very long which is to be expected at 7 pm on Saturday night. I decided to grab the only available table while my husband ordered our food. The table was dirty but it was the only unoccupied one so I asked to have it cleaned 4-6 minutes later the young man came back to clean the table. 

When our food arrived we weren't given silverware or plates. We went up to the counter and the silverware dispensers were all empty and there were no plates the hot mustard and chili sauces were all empty  as well . We asked for plates and silverware and had to wait a few minutes while our food got cold. I went to get some of the mandarin tea and it was empty and the chai was empty too! Due to the fact there was no clean tables, no clean silverware , dishes , the condiments were empty and we had no plates I have no choice but to give 2 stars.",2013-12-24,Las Vegas,-115.331443,36.161278,"['Fast Food', 'Chinese', 'Gluten-Free', 'Asian Fusion', 'Restaurants']"

4,Sura BBQ Buffet,"Came in on a Thursday afternoon for lunch with a friend. It was buffet style where all the marinated and raw meats were in containers. Everything from pork to beef, and some squid as well. They had soup and rice on the side and also a salad bar. For 20 bucks it wasn't bad for lunch. 

I would like to comment on the lack of a sauce station so I had to look for the sauces and mixes. There was not one particular server/ bidder they just all worked together.

5,Fukumimi Ramen,"It was so cold and we craved for some type of soup.  As my roommate has promoted to me, we decided to take a quick drive over.  I had their tonkotsu spicy and I requested the broth to be extra hot.  It came out so nice.  With a cold coming, my throat felt so good.  Their noodles were excellent and it was crunchy to me.  The sliced pork was very well portion and tender.  Soup was not too spicy.  Since my gf was afraid of spice, she went with the tonkotsu soy.  Judging by the fact that the bowl was empty.  It must have been solid for her. 

Service was above and beyond.  Because of my request for extra hot broth, they were a little confused.  They made an effort to have another person ask me what I asked to clear up the haze.  After we got out bill, we received a stamp card.  Buy 4 bowls and get one app free.  Winner! I do see us coming back again on a cold day.  

Place does get really packed.  We came in about 30 mins after opening and after it was full house.  There is bar seating and only about 5-6 tables.  Groups diners, you have been warned.",2013-01-26,Las Vegas,-115.117415621,36.100464402600004,"['Restaurants', 'Ramen', 'Japanese', 'Noodles']"

Oh, and one exception to the so-so food were the conch fritters. They were a little different than I've had before, with more crunch and spice. Awesome.

Most of it is a big shared space where you can bring your food to any open table.

1,Flavors The Buffet,This buffet was by far the worst I have ever had. The food tasted like it came from a commercial kitchen that provided quantity and not quality. It was flavorless and sometimes cold. The fact that there is little to no line should be a clue to the quality of fare they are putting out.  It is my hope that they spend a few extra dollars to hire a trained Executive Chef.  It is well worth the few dollars more to eat at the M Life Buffet or Backchannel Buffet. My advice if you find yourself at Flavors Buffet turn around and find another place to eat.

4,NYPD Pizza,"My stomach grumbles every time I think of their cheese calzone.  Mostly because it makes me hungry thinking about it, but partially because my stomach hates me after I devour that much cheese.  And I even split that beast in half and share it with someone else!

Seriously. That golden-brown top brushed with butter and garlic. That combination of mozzarella and sweet ricotta cheese...it's carb heaven.

Let's not mention that I start with their spinach & artichoke dip every time.  Served with a hot crunchy/chewy pizza crust with a light layer of melted cheese and garlic.  Sprinkle some crushed red pepper on it and I would eat that entire thing myself if I could, even though it's probably meant to be an appetizer for around 4 people.

5,B and B Ristorante,"Loves the quiet dim lit setting. We chose this place out of all the restaurants in Venetian/palazzo because we've never had any Mario batali's restaurant. From start to finish we had such a great overall experience. Our server made it extra special. Now, I started to overlook the other reviews and I noticed people said the servers were pretentious. I could see why people would think that. I'm reality the servers are just very passionate about their food and restaurant which I love and appreciate. Onto the food.

Grilled octopus: I hate octopus until now. It was so tender that it melted in mouth. It was amazing!

Sardines: absolutely tangy and fresh 

Foie gras ravioli: delicious

3,Epicure Cafe & Grill,"I often go this restaurant because of the atmosphere; brick-like walls, pictures of Degas and high ceiling.

At the begining, I was a big fan of their burgers, especially the super soy pate and fried potate which comes with a burger. These burgers were funtastic last year. However, last two attempts in this year were a bit different. Less satisfaction - somehow - although it's still good and I enjoyed them.

Last night, I tried Pumpkin Ravioli instead Swiss burger (my favorit!). It was good, but again, something was missing. And so, I moved to dessert to fill up my desire, not my stomach. Dessert (tiramisu) was great. It was a fluffy type of it. I'd like to try others in the future.

3,Gallo Blanco,"I wish Yelp would let us give half stars...cause this place would definitely be getting 2.5 stars from me. However, since I don't have that luxury, and since I'm feeling generous, we'll go with 3. 

Suffice it to say, I didn't think this place was anywhere NEAR as good as some of my foreyelpers. According to my dinner-mate (who also lives in Phoenix), the restaurant at the Claredon Hotel has had some identity crises in the past...Gallo Blanco is merely the latest manifestation and has only been open a few weeks. The ambiance was pretty good (earning this place one of its stars)...the dimly lit, minimalist-designed dining room with exposed concrete flooring lent itself well to the theme of the restaurant, with great big windows on one end.

Our waitress was an adorable blonde from Manchester, England, who was very sweet and attentive, and the service was fabulous the whole evening...seriously, our food came out in the blink of any eye! I know others have complained that the service was slow, so all I have to say to them is that maybe they stepped up their game in the past few days or something...anyway, it was wicked fast (point for Ms. Manchester and the quick entree-serving, too). 

So...here's where lack of stars comes in: the food. We started with the Guacamole, which one yelper claimed was the, ""best guacamole you'll ever taste."" This is false. It is NOT the best guacamole you'll ever taste. It doesn't even rank in my top 10. I guess I like more traditional guacamole, because this was NOT traditional, and it just didn't really hit the spot for me. It was very chunky and had actual slices of little tangerines (i think) in it. The ""hint of orange"" was, in my opinion, a drawback. I just...didn't love it. Or even like it that much. I think I make better guac at home. Along with the guac, we also got a tomatillo sauce that was very boring...I've had some excellent tomatillos, and this didn't rank.

For my meal, I ordered the Cochinita Torta, which is basically pork served on a bun with some lettuce and some sort of aoili. I had read good reviews about the pork torta, but was hugely disappointed. First of all, the bun is like...one that you'd buy in the grocery store. NOTHING special about it, which was slightly disappointing. It just didn't have the constitution to really contain or complement the contents of the torta. The torta contents themselves were also nothing to write home about. My biggest complaint was the fact that there wasn't much pork, and the pork that was there wasn't, honestly, all that great. The aoili (which was seriously not much of a step above mayo) totally overpowered the pork and made the sandwich kind of...soggy. A soggy mayo and pork sandwich. That's what I had. It wasn't very good.

I think next time I'd go with the tacos...my friend ordered them and they looked less...disappointing. She appeared to like them pretty well.

The other star that I HAVE to give this place, though, is for the prices...$6.50 for the torta and $4.00 for the 2 tacos. We didn't get any alcohol, so all in all we spent $11 apiece. I may not have liked my food, but at least I didn't spend a fortune on it. The price is the only thing that would entice me to come back and try something else.",2009-05-07,Phoenix,-112.079081,33.49112,"['Burgers', 'Nightlife', 'Cafes', 'Restaurants', 'Bars', 'Sandwiches', 'Salad', 'Mexican']"

1,Cafe Porta Alba,"First off, let me say that I love Cafe Novanta on the west side, which is owned by the same people.  However, Cafe Novanta hires outgoing competent employees, which Porta Alba lacks.  

After a gruff ""two?,"" without a smile, we were seated and given menus.  Our server did come over and greet us and asked if we needed some time.  We told her we did, and she left for what seemed like eternity.  Looking at my cell phone clock, it was in fact 10 - 15 minutes.  When she returned we placed our orders, which included an appetizer of the focaccia bread.  We then waited 30 minutes to receive the appetizer.  At one point, after 20 minutes, I heard the server ask the cook where her focaccia was.  He shrugged and indicated he didn't know about it.  It then took an additional 10 minutes.  After we received and at the focaccia, it then took another 20 minutes to receive our entrees.  After finishing the entrees it was another 15 minutes to get the server's attention to get the bill.

The food was quite good, just like Novanta.  However, the service was terrible.  I was shocked when the focaccia appeared on the bill.  I thought for sure there would be no charge.  

By the way - the place wasn't even crowded, so there was no excuse for the slow service.  There were roughly 6 tables with parties of two at each.  There were two servers from what I could tell.  If the kitchen was the problem, they need to hire another cook.

Go to Novanta would be my recommendation - the staff there is wonderful and speedy!",2014-02-14,Madison,-89.45128609999999,43.0721304,"['Restaurants', 'Italian', 'Pizza']"

We had coconut shrimp and the chicken/shrimp fried dumplings for apps. Both were very tasty though the coconut shrimp had a little too much breading and was fried a little too hard. But enjoyable nonetheless.

My husband's sizzling mixed seafood combo was very good although couldve used a sauce to compliment the dish. My short ribs and mixed greens salad was great! I received 4 huge pieces of ribs and a nice sauce to dip on the side.

Also if you order food!! ewwww don't get the calamari that was so gross!! it tasted like rubber!! 
Also the music is ok but its just way to loud, you cant have a conversation with someone next to you; you will have to yell at each other. (to be able to hear one another) 
My tip for the Female bartenders would be to acknowledge all of your clients, and actually smile and try to interact a little. Make us feel welcomed!!! 
also to the owner or whom ever is in charge of the audio set up; turn the volume just a little down!! (I would also play more verity of music as well) it gets a little boring!    To top it off it's a SPORTS Bar & all they have on the tv's playing are music videos!!! lmao!!!!

The atmosphere is supposed to make you feel like you're in Mexico on the beach drinkin' with your buddies, and it pretty much delivers. It's a good place to go for a casual relaxed hangs with people after work, but as the late night crowd starts to roll in it becomes more like your typical club with loud music and more tipsy patrons.

4,Little Sheep Mongolian Hot Pot,"I got the opportunity to return again to give this page a chance. The manager said the employees have been retrained.

The service has indeed improved A LOT! There's more staff in the floor, and they actually check up on you. They take initiative to ask if you want to order your next round or just drop by to refill the soupbase. It's also easy to call for service now as well. Food came out really fast too.

One thing that irked me a little: I love mantou (deep fried bun), and these are only good when it's fresh. Since we arrived all the way til we're ready for dessert (a good 2 hrs), the batch of mantou was just sitting there and never changed. So when we tried one, it was cold and pretty hard already. I told the server about it, and if they can make a fresh batch since it's been sitting there. The server told me that since there's still mantous left in the existing batch then we'll have to wait til it finishes. I was like: are you serious? That batch is not good anymore and
 you want people to eat that? The server said she'll check with the manager, and they did change it.

I think those food in the buffet items need to be reconsidered. Maybe make it order by request so it's guaranteed fresh or they need to have a freshness timer where they need to replace any existing batch after 1 hour. Otherwise, nobody's going to eat that.

Aside from the hiccup with the mantou, I really enjoyed my experience here now. The food itself was never really an issue for me here. So if they can make that level of service consistent, it would be a great hotpot place to keep visiting.",2016-05-01,Toronto,-79.3953229055,43.6532650596,"['Chinese', 'Mongolian', 'Restaurants', 'Hot Pot']"

3,The Kort Haus,"*3.5 rating*
Came after softball for obligatory wings and beer. The place is fairly nicely decorated and open; however we went with the patio with it being summertime.

There's a pretty large menu, but I was in wing mode. There's over a dozen flavors and you can have them breaded or regular. The wings are about $11 per pound - and they stick to the true pound: so about 7-8 larger wings. They do offer slightly cheaper for every extra pound, but emphasis on the slightly (like 25 cents). Not bad, but not great value either. That said, they do have a wing platter at just over $13 which includes a pound of wings, a side, dip with carrot and celery, and coleslaw. That's actually great value.

I had the habenero-mango. They were spicy, and I could detect some tangy-ness - but the mango could've been a little more evident. My wife had the same platter but had the standard hot. We both felt the wings were solid and worth getting again - albeit not much to distinguish themselves. Our sides could be described the same.

It's enough to try again, and I know from the YELP event that their burgers are pretty good.",2015-07-17,Brampton,-79.7215695307,43.6597768434,"['Food', 'Nightlife', 'Bars', 'Ethnic Food', 'Beer', 'Wine & Spirits', 'Restaurants', 'Canadian (New)', 'Specialty Food', 'Sports Bars', 'Burgers', 'Pubs']"

We were the only people in the restaurant, which worried me as I have no idea if the food is good or bad and maybe that was a sign as it was dinnertime. They brought a basket of bread to the table right away along with water and bread plates. There was nothing on the menu that stuck out and said ""TRY ME"" so I ordered a french onion soup to start and my boyfriend ordered the soup of the day which was butternut squash.

I found my soup to taste like a container of salt but I was hungry so I ate it and the butternut squash I was told was very good but I didn't taste it, I'll take his word for it though. We both ordered the veal parmigiana and it wasn't long coming out..

Before the waiter walked away from bringing our dinner, my boyfriend saw that his veal was completely raw looking! I immediately cut into my  piece and it was pink inside too!!

The waiter didn't know what to say and he took our plates back, he came back two minutes later and told us the chef is going to do some"" chef tricks"" whatever that means...

I personally didn't want back this raw piece of meat back and luckily we didn't get it back either. The waiter came back and said the chef cooked another piece of meat and it was also pink inside.. I do not know what is wrong with this meat and believe me I do not want to find out so we just paid for our soups and left..

I can go on and on about how great the food was (maybe because I love french food) but the dessert was THE main event for me.

2 things : the crepe station and the creme brulee

I was on the hunt for spicy food, some of my fellow yelpers recommended this place so I decided to give Pan Asian a try. 

As a starter we ordered the Gyoza, it was good, crispy on the outside and soft and delicious on the inside. 

For my main meal I ordered the linguini noodles with chicken, my palate is very sensitive so on the scale of 1 to 10 of spiciness I ordered a 2. Let's just say I'm ordering a 1 next time. The noodles were amazing though, they were packed with a lot of flavor and a great amount of kick, my nose was running like niagara falls the entire meal. I'm not sure what noodles my husband ordered but he did order the noodles a level 8, he said he liked them as well but was expecting the noodles to be spicier, he's going with a level 10 next time. 

For dessert we ordered the deep fried cheesecake, it's like a slice of Heaven in your mouth, its so rich and creamy and it's served with whipped cream and ice cream.

1,Sweet Melissa,"I've been to this location a couple times before tonight and the service was always mediocre at best and the food was just okay. However, I didn't protest going there for dinner tonight with my boyfriend and that was a huge mistake! Our waitress was never around and when she was she seemed annoyed and disinterested. It was Taco Tuesday so we ordered two tacos as an appetizer and both of our tacos were missing 3 of the 5 ingredients! The waitress just brought the missing ingredients out on the side and we made our own tacos instead of getting them prepared again. We were willing to let everything go and just continue on with our dinner until I found not one, but two, hairs in my burger. The manager apologized for the hair in my food and comped our meal but didn't really have anything to say about our taco situation or about the service. This was definitely my last time at sweet melissa.",2016-01-06,Rocky River,-81.8366502362,41.4813363086,"['Desserts', 'American (Traditional)', 'Restaurants', 'Food', 'Caterers', 'Event Planning & Services', 'Diners']"
2,Village Seafood Buffet,"For $50 per person and the acclaimed best seafood buffet in Las Vegas, this was a huge let down as well. We've gone here before and the food usually was ok. Walking out of the restaurant, you didn't mind that the cost was one of the highest buffet costs in town. However, this time around, the food quality was very poor. There were several items where we had one bite and decided not to finish the rest of it. The lobster tails were highly engulfed in butter along with other seafood options. The taste was poor. The crab legs were decent as it had a fairly sweet taste to the crab meat. However, almost everything else on the buffet line was dry and poorly seasoned. I don't know if they are cutting back due to the economy, but to continue charging that price while delivering subpar food quality leaves us not wanting to make another trip back to this buffet anytime soon.",2011-11-24,Las Vegas,-115.187298,36.118117,"['Seafood', 'Buffets', 'Restaurants']"

For about 40-45 minutes after we ordered, we watched 3-4 employees walk in and out of the kitchen with no food. When the food did come, it was absolutely delicious!!! We thought maybe there was only one cook who had to make one dish at a time. However, in those 45 minutes the restaurant filled up with 7-8 tables.

I haven't eaten a lot of bahn mi since moving to Vegas, and I really like them so I was excited to give this place a try.  Since I've been making pho at home for every meal I eat in, I wasn't about to order their pho.  THAT would just be pho-king extreme.

I ordered the spring rolls and #57, which I think was steamed pork and pate.  Can I just say, YUMMY IN MY TUMMY!!!  The spring rolls could've used a little more meat and shrimp, but it was still really good.  It wasn't dry and rubbery like some spring rolls tend to be when it's not fresh.  My sandwich was so delicious. The bread is impossibly crispy and soft at the same time, and the fillings were ample.  I loved the subtle sweetness in the mayo that they use here as well.  If I am craving bahn mi, I will definitely stop here. For a mere 3 bucks a pop, sign me up!

One negative is that the server never came back to refill my water even though it was sitting on the edge of the table empty for nearly the entire meal.

We ordered a Not-Yo (Nacho) pizza, Popeye Joun and lentil soup for 2 to share. 

The pizza toppings included olives, jalapenos, onion and cheese. The outer crust was decent but the bottom layer under the toppings was kinda soggy. 

The popeye joun was made into a wrap. It wasnt grilled well so it was still lukewarm inside. We were hungry and didnt care so we ate it anyway and didnt bother to get it reheated. 

The lentil soup was bland. Kind of tasted like plain white congee mixed with cumin.

This is a good steak house. The salad that accompanied our filet mignon was huge and delicious. It could have served as a meal by itself. The baked potato was also quite big and covered in a tasty preparation that enhanced its flavor. The filet itself was properly prepared and lightly covered with a tasty sauce. The wait staff was quite personable and , between the waiter and the bus boys, our glasses were never empty. There were many choices of wines available, but none very notable.

the SOUTHERN FRIED CHICKEN is what you have pictured in your head when you finally cave in to your inner fat kid and get KFC, yet it's so far from the greasy, salty bucket o' mess. disappointing though that the chicken was served with sweet chili thai sauce and gravy, both in plastic dip cups. the slightest additional effort to have proper dishware would've made a big difference, even with generic tasting sauce.

CAJUN SMOKED SIDE RIBS are a secret entrée hidden in the appetizers for any carnivore with a small appetite (oxymoron?). fall-off-the-bone, tender, laced in dat sawce. satisfying, served with collard greens (yum) and rice.

5,Thai Rama,"Far from the best Thai food I've had, but the best Thai I've had in Arizona.

Visited with friends while in Phoenix one night.  I had low expectations.   We ordered fish cakes and papaya salad to share.  I had a red vegetable curry.  The waitress was friendly, and my friends ordered their meals Thai hot.   I'd been suffering from bland food for several days, and   I explained that I wanted my meal much hotter than theirs.  That I wanted to cry on the first bite.   My friend summarized-- ""9/11 hot"".    

The fish cakes were excellent,  which led to unspoken hostility over who would get the last piece.  The Papaya salad was full of flavor and intense heat that took some time to appear over the sweet and cold flavors of the salad.

The main meal was served as I ordered it.  I cried on the first bite.  It was like tear gas in a bowl.    The heat was mostly from fresh diced chilis-- perfect.   This made me very happy.   It's so difficult to find a restaurant that serves hot when requested.

Curry was a bit lacking in vegetables, should have made my usual request for extra broccoli.",2009-09-10,Tempe,-111.92523100000001,33.421712,"['Thai', 'Restaurants']"

5,Lucy Ethiopian Restaurant & Bar,"Mio bello said I have an international appetite.  It's a fact.  In Las Vegas we're spoiled with the variety of ethnic food that's convenient and available in multitude.  There are more Ethiopian restaurants in Vegas that have opened since 5 months ago.  Lucy's is the second Ethiopian restaurant I've dined.  

Their vegetable combo platter is huge and for a good price.  My favorite is the shiro wat and lentils.  Both are a little spicy and I love the flavors.  The pancakes are called injera and they're served cold.  There's a little tangy taste to them which I enjoy very much, especially paired with the spicy food.  

The chicken and rice plate comes with a healthy portion as well.  Chicken is spiced very nicely.  There were jalapenos scattered on top.  The chicken itself seemed fried but wasn't greasy.  They look like seasoned potato square chunks.  Really tasty chicken pieces.

Both dishes came with a green salad.  Perfectly crunchy fresh lettuce, tomatoes, and onions dressed with a mixture of something I'm unsure of.  I ate every little piece of lettuce.  Their salad was great!

I should've asked the name of our pleasant server.  She was super attentive and a sweetheart.  After ordering, our food was delivered to the table in fair time.  For the veggie combo, it's meant to eat with hands.  I asked for a fork though :P.  Our leftovers which I expected was prepared in take out containers by our server; really kind of her.

Menu is for breakfast, lunch, and dinner.  Desserts and beer are served here.  They're open super late!  I should say til super early - 4am!  In the evening, the parking lot is lit so brightly.  Outdoor seating is even available; of course not recommended in the winter season.  The location is not too far from the strip, but closer to Palms and Rio.

This restaurant has a blue and green neon light bar, lots of seating, live TV's along the walls, music on the speaker for entertainment, dancing laser dots, and a multi-colored disco globe light which wasn't on.  The interior is dim, but it was cool with the neon lighting coming from the bar.  Tables set up at the wall had traditional chairs and colorful woven basket-like tables with covers.

I expected more.  Well, actually I'm not sure what I expected, but it wasn't this.  

However, we did enjoy the food.  The poutine was good, but the fries could have been cooked longer.  I found that for $22 my daughter and I got more food than we could even dream of eating.  She got the chicken wing meal and I got a hot dog and poutine.  I ate the dog(plain old hot dog), but was too full to eat all the poutine.  My daughter ate her wings, maybe a third of her fries and couldn't get to the slaw.

I thought  his Dynamite roll was delicious and wish I would have ordered that instead.

The crepe was done well, and gave off that freshly baked scent with every bite, as the ingredients oozed out. 

I also got a glass of the house lemonade (lemonade maison), which was an interesting take on lemonade. I think they mixed lemon juice with soda water, and then blended it with bits of basil! It was a very refreshing taste, with a hint of herbal fragrance and a slight bitterness from the soda.

The other half of the joy of dining here is the atmosphere. The courtyard is a really amazing place to sit.

Ambient- sound bounced of the walls and couldn't really have a talk with out contributing to the already loud room. Lighting not great. Beautiful mexican culture inspired art. Loved it.

1,Pacific Seafood Buffet,"My husband and I have been here twice. The 1st time, it was a nice experience, not too busy, we were greeted right away, server was attentive. The food here is a better quality buffet and they have an huge variety of different foods that normally aren't seen in other Chinese buffets.  (You have to be willing to try some really different things). 

The 2nd time we came here, it was AWFUL from the start. It was busy but I wouldn't say slammed. We came in and I saw two gals by the cash register. I said hello and we waited, waited, waited for them to even LOOK UP at us. After a few MINUTES of us STARING at them they finally looked at us and then continued to ignore us. I was shocked at how they were blatantly ignoring us. Finally a 3rd girl came over and FINALLY seated us. We ended up with two very confused servers who couldn't figure out whose table it was. 

Like the time before, the food was very good, same exotic variety. When we were finished with our meal, our server took our credit card and we waited, waited, waited. After about 15 minutes of waiting for my credit card to come back to me, I got nervous and went up the cash register. As I walked up, there was my credit card-on the counter, face up, with all the numbers very clearly visible & displayed to whoever walked by it along with several other people's cards that were spread out on the counter-right next to the pathway to the door. There were 3 servers at the register, all of whom were at least 8 feet away from the cards with their backs to it while they chatted. Who knows how long any of those cards had been there. I was so furious when I saw this. I demanded to know why my credit card was sitting on the counter in the open, face up with no one even WATCHING to make sure it wasn't stolen. They had no explanation and simply spit out some lame ""I'm sorry"" to me. 

I don't care how awesome the food is, bad service is bad service. One should be able to hand a credit card to the server to pay for their meal w/o worrying about the numbers or even the card itself being stolen.

I received a message reply from Bettina (and my name is WINDY, not Wendy) on June 15th  to send my contact information via email which I did. I promptly received the following response from Kevin Berk;

Hi Windy,
And thank you very much for sending your contact info to us. I will have the manager get in touch with you today and we will make this right for you. Again, we are very sorry for our poor showing. We expect and will deliver a better experience next time.

Thank you for your understanding and your patience.  If for some reason you do not hear from them today, please let me know.

Best regards,
Kevin


TODAY is Friday June 21st, I have not heard from Ahwatukee PJ and sent Kevin an email that I am very disappointed.


This PJ is not worth my time or money.  I wish I trusted the reviews and chose a different option for dinner. This company doesn't care about their customer, charges them for items not ordered and does not refund their money.",2013-06-22,Phoenix,-111.97651640000001,33.3172434,"['Restaurants', 'American (New)', 'Vegetarian', 'Mediterranean']"
3,Five50 Pizza Bar,"Okay so really the pizza here isn't bad..but it is expensive.  So why not pay a few dollars more and get the truffle since all the pizzas are around the same price.  So I did like that there was a good truffle flavor (I think they toss some truffle oil to enhance the flavor), however there is wayyy too much cheese.  I felt so gross eating, and definitely exceeded by fat content for the week.  If you do decide to try this, I recommend just getting a slice, rather than an entire pizza like we did.",2014-02-07,Las Vegas,-115.173703,36.107291,"['Pizza', 'Restaurants']"
2,Sauce Pizza & Wine,"It is a bit shocking to me that people like this place so much.  Have they just not had a really good pizza before?  I really don't get it.

The first time I tried Sauce, I went with the hand-stretched chicken pesto pizza.  It was OK - good crust, but a little too sparse on the toppings.  I really wish when they made these pesto pizzas that they'd try to make the pesto stand out a little more.  They always try to go light on the pesto because people in Arizona hate things that taste good, and pure, unadultered pesto tastes good.

My recent visit, I went to the Dana Park location, and I made a huge mistake - I accidentally ordered the thin crust.  I blame the person behind the register for not reminding me that they have two crusts (good, and pure sh*t), and of course, by default, they give you that horrible cracker crust.

So my meal was effectively ruined, even though I felt I made a solid choice with the portobello and artichoke.

People might tell you Sauce is good, and they might have even been eating their awful cracker crust pizza - but make no mistake, that crust is the worst.  If you get the flatbread pizza, you will be getting a much more average pie, and it may even be a reasonable choice for the Mesa/Gilbert area.  But I give them two stars just for offering that abortion of a crust as the standard option.",2013-07-22,Mesa,-111.756963466,33.3811254605,"['Restaurants', 'Food', 'Italian', 'Beer', 'Wine & Spirits', 'Pizza']"
3,Melt Bar & Grilled,"It was my first time at the Melt. I had a cheesesteak. Which was really good in my opinion. The fries were amazing, the sandwich was so big that I could barely fit it into my mouth to take a bite so for the portion size you pay for the price is pretty decent. I ordered the electric blueberry lemonade which was disappointing. It tasted like lemonade, you couldn't taste the vodka & there were about 20 mint leaves in the glass so it all got sucked into the straw whenever I attempted to drink any of it. I ordered the brau weisse afterward which was much better. We ordered the Oktoberfest dessert of the month which was supposed to be a bread pudding and instead we were served a brownie with ice cream on top of it. The dessert we received and the dessert we ordered were two completely separate dishes. The server was also the bartender & he was nice. I guess they need more staff. We ate outside on the patio which we basically had all to ourselves. I would come again but be more careful of what I order.",2015-09-28,Lakewood,-81.7990467,41.485344700000006,"['Sandwiches', 'Restaurants', 'American (Traditional)', 'Nightlife', 'Bars', 'Comfort Food', 'Pubs']"
1,Pampas Brazilian Grille,"I read multiple negative reviews here that I couldn't agree with more. 

THE STAFF DOESN'T CARE.

I do NOT recommend getting the show/dinner package that comes with many show ticket promotions. The restaurant they pair you with called Pampas Brazilian Grille are a bunch of jerks. They have two lines they put you in... one for show vouchers and one for walk-in customers. They told us 25 minutes (two hours before the show) that they would seat us. They said they would page us. While I am sitting there they are seating each and every walk-in customer. They never paged us at all. I got pissed off and went next door to Todai and they were kind enough to give us $20 off each meal just because of my experience there. They had indicated to us that Pampas gets plenty of haters.",2015-03-19,Las Vegas,-115.17011699999999,36.10877,"['Buffets', 'Restaurants', 'Brazilian', 'Steakhouses']"

3,Hawaiian Style Poke,"Came here last Friday, right when the sun was going down. Most of the trays were empty already, which is always a good sign. The people behind the counter weren't the most talkative, but that's not to say that they were unfriendly. Poke bowls were about $10 and the wife and I decided to share one, just to try it out. We opted for a spicy ahi bowl. Rice was delicious, fish was good too, but we felt that the fish needed a little bit more seasoning to it. We added some soy sauce and that helped out. I thought it was gonna be the spicy one that comes with that spicy mayo dressing, but I guess there's different spicy ahi variations? I saw some spam musubi on the counter, but it looked old........ : (  It could have been my eyes though.  I really did enjoy my bowl, but I think I'd like to come back at an earlier time on our next visit to LV, so I can experience what some of the other Yelpers have experienced.",2014-11-15,Las Vegas,-115.194485875,36.1255480744,"['Restaurants', 'Hawaiian', 'Food', 'Poke']"

5,CUT,"Disclaimer:  Our reservation was coordinated through a mutual friend and GM of The Source, a Wolfgang Puck restaurant in DC.

When we were in Vegas a month ago for the cigar convention, we had heard from a ton of people that we had to try CUT.  We got a reservation and decided to hit the bar beforehand.  The bartender was incredibly polite and had a real good time talking to him.  We tried some new shots and had some excellent Manhattans.

The GM/Host let us know our table was ready.  After being sat, and introductions, they showed us their wine list, which is on an iPad.  It was very easy to pick the Bordeaux that we wanted (2005 Chateau Gracia).  While we waited for that, we put in an order of appetizers (Maryland Blue Crab and Jumbo Shrimp Crab Cake and also Pork Bellys).  Both were excellent, but I could have eaten that crab cake all day long.

Our wine was brought out exactly as it should have been.  Presented to the person who ordered it and then poured to the others from there. Myself and a friend ordered the 28 day Rib Eye, and our other friend ordered the Wagyu. For sides we had the squash dish and I think potato something.

Crumbs from bread never lasted long.  Someone was always there refilling glasses or cleaning the table.  We knew a lot of people that week and many stopped by.  The staff took notice and never attempted to interfere or rush us to the next part of our meal.  A good friend from a neighboring table decided to buy us a bottle of wine, and once again the iPad menu came out.  The wine can be pricey, so I simply opted to choose a region and allow them to choose the wine.  The Waitress was accommodating and polite throughout the process informing the gentlemen we had chosen a Bordeaux.  The bottle we received was a 1999 Chateau Leoville Barton which went excellent with out meal.

Needless to say, between the Manhattans and the wine, we were all feeling a little good at this point and perhaps even a bit loud for the restaurant.  That being said, we were never asked to be quiet or leave.   Later two desserts were brought to our table that we did not order, we're still unsure if these were from the chef or from our friend who we had been at the bar with and had since returned.

I have never had such a beautiful meal or wonderful service.  The gentlemen who took care of us most this night was Pasquale, when I return I will definitely request him.",2011-08-18,Las Vegas,-115.16833500000001,36.123453999999995,"['Bars', 'Lounges', 'Restaurants', 'Nightlife', 'Steakhouses']"

We got in line at Snacks and it didn't move for like 5 minutes, which when you're drunk and you want fries that's way too long!  Plus the prices at Snacks were ridic.  So we said screw it, let's go somewhere else.  Somehow we ended up at Planet Hollywood and were looking for somewhere to get food.  That's how we found The Earl.  

So we walk up to the counter, I didn't even notice the prices until after I ordered.  Great prices for Vegas!  So I ordered like a grilled cheese type sandwich and my friend ordered a Tuna wrap.  Both were delicious!  I must admit that cheese in my sandwich was probably not a good idea a little later that night BUT that doesn't change the fact that the sandwich was really outstanding!

I asked for suggestions on the tacos and the waitress suggested the bistec taco.  I asked if the steak was cooked through (I'm picky about how my meat is cooked) and she said yes.  I didn't want any pink in the steak and when the taco arrived and I took my first bite, all of it was chewy.  I took out the meat and cut them in half to find every single piece bright red.  If you're not a fan of medium rare steak, than I'd pass on this item.  I also went with the portobello taco and it was decent, flavorful.

In addition to the chips and gauc, we got the chips and salsa.  The chips and salsa came with a green and red salsa.  The green salsa was delicious and the red salsa had a spicy kick to it!  It was also good but had a sweetness that I didn't care for as much.

AC is pretty loud and I can see how it can annoy guests but I slept well anyways. Pool is 24 hours and people seemed to be having fun(I didn't go in person) throughout the night. You can tell that the casino and room are older I feel they do make an effort to keep it clean and maintained but have given up on renovation. First time I flushed the toilet it seemed clogged so I emptied a trashcan filled it with water and got it to work that way but after that no issues with it.

As we we found the resto and entered, I found the decoration pleasing but as we sat down and saw the menu for our livingsocial coupon...NOT IMPRESSED! I found the prices for the appetizers to be ridiculous and not worth it. We were only allowed to pick a limit of 7$ for the appetizers which is ridiculous because there was only 2 items: the soup du jour and a really not so good bruschetta. I took the bruschetta and my boyfriend took the soup. I would NEVER pay 6.95$ for neither. 

After the main course had a limit of 17$. I took the 4 cheeses pizza which was really good because of its thin crust and my bf took a plain spaghetti cuz he is lactose intolerant. But cmon....16.95$ for a plain spaghetti screams overpriced! 

Last but not least, i wanted a classic italian dessert that was homemade....nothing was homemade on the dessert menu. very disappointing! 

I also really got annoyed because when i usually use a livingsocial coupon, I have never been asked to print it and I basically just show it and they write down the voucher number. The lady who is probably the owner, didnt stop annoying me about printing it and then she comes to me with a paper with their email and pressed me to email them the coupon and didnt stop harassing me about the damn coupon.

4,8 Noodle Bar,"After four visits to 8 Noodle Bar, I have to write an update and up the stars to four.  Tonight I had shrimp toast and 5 spice beef soup.  Both were very good.  The shrimp toast consists of rock shrimp, fried egg, water chestnuts, scallions, spicy mayo,  and eel sauce.  An absolute delight and blend of flavors.

The 5 spice beef soup consists of brisket, beef broth, choy sum, udon noodle, cilantro, chili, and lime.  The 5 spice was a wonderful flavoring to the beef broth.  The chefs put the soup bowls in hot water before filling them with broth or noodles.

Service tonight was as good as it always is.  My server was Gerardo and once again, I did not have to ask for an iced tea refill.  My glass was refilled automatically.  Another thing of merit is that they coursed my meal unlike many Asian restaurants.  They waited until my shrimp toast was done and I had a few minutes to just sit.  Then my soup was prepared and served.  That really is a plus.

I enjoy sitting at the bar as I dine solo.  I can watch the cooks do their thing right on the other side and have a show with my meal.

Since this is just a mile from home, I'll be back again.  If the menu had more choices, it could merit an extra star but it is a limited menu because it's a limited space.

The bi bim bap was on point with something you would get in The Motherland. The stoneware was über hot thus I was able to make lots of crunchy rice. The best part was they cracked a fresh egg on the rice. My #1 pet peeve when I order bi bim bap is that they fry the egg separately and dump it on the rice.

The service is also a mixed bag.  The first time our server went out of her way to take care of us and even MADE me cocktail sauce for my fish sandwich.  The second time, the server was lackluster, didn't know anything about the menu and wasn't able to take proper care of us.

4,Can't Stop Smokin' BBQ,"It's hard to review Can't Stop Smoking BBQ without referencing Rudy's BBQ right across the street.  I give Rudy's the edge on atmosphere, and the meats themselves were juicier and a little more flavorful... but EVERY other possible advantage goes to Can't Stop Smoking (CSS).  The sides, sauces, portions, value, variety, healthiness, accessibility, etc all favor CSS.

Upon entering, you grab an impressively heavy aluminum tray and go through a cafeteria line acquiring sliced meats.  I got a 2-meat combo, with a half-ear of corn, 2 sides, cornbread muffin, and a drink for $10.  (They also email coupons and have a stamp card.... which knocked the price down closer to $7.)  The turkey and brisket were both super lean, which I happen to like, even though that made them somewhat dry.  The turkey had a nice smokey flavor, but the dry rub on the brisket was uneven and overly salty/spicy in some bites.  No big deal because I enjoyed both the standard and spicy BBQ sauce options much better than the sauce at Rudy's.

The muffin and mac & cheese were both above average.  Amazingly, the corn wasn't totally overcooked like at most places, but I discovered that I hate mustard greens and had wasted one of my choices of sides.  Some of my friends ordered the ribs and said that was the best thing on the menu.

So where does that leave us?  Is it possible that I like the meat better at Rudy's and still like CSS better?  Yes, I think so.  I didn't have to wait in a huge line, struggle to find a table, or slice huge hunks of fat off my brisket.  (I also didn't feel gross when I left.)  I was able to order a combo, instead of ""decoding"" the menu to determine how much meat to order for my Wonderbread.  Can't Stop Smoking is a more commercial, more conventional experience than Rudy's, but I liked it.",2012-06-27,Chandler,-111.9668412,33.3057345,"['Beer', 'Wine & Spirits', 'Restaurants', 'American (Traditional)', 'Barbeque', 'Buffets', 'Grocery', 'Food']"

I got the chicken and herb calzone, he got the small Gotham.  The calzone (which was HUGE) had fresh tomatoes and herbs, cheese was evenly melted, and the chicken was nice and juicy.  As much as I hate to admit it, though, his pizza trumped all others I've had in Vegas.  The meat was juicy chunks of ground beef and pepperoni.  The crust was just the right amount of flaky and crunchy.  Mmmmm!!

Our waiter was very sweet and polite.  He seemed to be a hard worker as he was not only helping us, but cleaning about and doing other duties while the others didn't seem to be doing much.  Unfortunately, there was a weird smell towards the back of the restaurant where we were seated.  Almost a wet table rag smell.  The food and service made up for it though.

4,Zaba's Mexican Grill,"Came here on a late Sunday night after visiting a few shops nearby. I've never heard of Zaba's and so me and my friend decided to check it out. 
Right when we walked in, the first thing we had to search for was the menu (which was posted above the kitchen) and to our surprise it was much similar to Chipotle. 
The line wasn't too long nor too short so we had time to decide what to pick. You can customize your order OR you can pick Zaba's favorite meal(s) that include tacos, burritos, a bowl, quesadilla, nachos and a salad. 
My friend chooses to customize her 3 carnitas tacos while I chose Doug's Surf and Turf Burrito (one of the favorites- $10). 
The workers knew what goes inside the Surf and Turf and magically worked on my burrito, putting the necessary ingredients such as the shrimp, potatoes, pico de gallo, guacamole, rice, hot salsa, and steak (talk about a mouth-flavoring burrito!) My friend, on the other hand, had carnitas, corn, pico de gallo, rice and beans on all three of her tacos. The server generously piled the toppings on top of the corn tortillas and my friend couldn't finish her third taco. And as an additional treat (we always get this at Chipotle), we got the Chips and Guacamole ($2.39). Chips had a slight lime flavor and the guacamole wasn't as spectacular as I'd hope so {Chipotle won this round}. Lastly on my receipt, we got 2 large fountain sodas (est. $5). All in all, I paid $24 for a tummy of two and left the restaurant full and satisfied (she's still a chipotle fan-Grrr lol)

I see why Zaba's is slowly climbing up to Chipotle not because of similarity, but more of a slight, unique twist it has. Zaba's has more of a kick and spicyness that Chipotle tends to lack and I'm all about full-on flavor. 
Zaba's also has fish tacos, shrimp tacos, and nacho- which gives a variety of opportunities for those who dread the typical Chipotle meat menu. 

I'll be coming here more often to explore their menu. Great place to stop by at Downtown Summerlin Mall if you're nearby! Highly recommend =)",2014-12-15,Las Vegas,-115.333592556,36.1482461131,"['Restaurants', 'Mexican']"
4,Buca di Beppo Italian Restaurant,"This is defiantly a place to big a large family or a group of friends! However if you are going in a smaller group such as 2-3 people I would not recommend this place at all and here is why... All the dishes are served family style which means you must all agree on all your selections unless your going to have a lot of left overs and will be left with a large bill at the end which brings me to my next point. If you are in a smaller group and you all don't agree on a dish and you get a something only you will eat you will most likely spend between $20-$35 per dish now if you are if a larger group that's great! I wish this restaurant offered a menu for couples of two with much smaller portions or even a small list of items which you can get just one of and not need to share. If we would have known that this restaurant was only family style we would have not gone here because it was such a waste for us. There is a plus and a nice touch to this restaurant there was a photographer coming to each table and taking a ""free"" photo ( which is the size of a post stamp ) unless you want to spend $25 for one or $30 for two.

I often get extra to eat with my fries.

2,The Cafe at Monte Carlo,"Stopped in on a Wednesday morning for breakfast since we were guests in the Monte Carlo hotel.  We were seated instantly and there were only two other tables that were occupied in our section.  After being seated, we were never acknowledge or greeted by our server for about 10 minutes even though she and her assistant saw us. Not even offered a cup of coffee or water which I thought was very unusual for a coffee shop/cafe restaurant inside of a large hotel/casino. 
Our server finally came over and took our order which was a typical and simple breakfast order.  We waited and waited for our food all while our server came by a couple times to tell us it was almost done and to refill our coffee.  A runner finally brought our meal out and mine was wrong so he took it back to be corrected and returned it very fast.  
The food was good but it was ice cold and after waiting so long for it there was no way I was going to send it back.  By now, our section had started to fill up and I noticed how fast other orders were being taken and food being served.  All I can say was that it was like the minute we sat down we were totally invisible to our server and everyone else that worked there. 
Again, the food was good (but cold) but the real problem here was the service. It was horrible and I won't be finding myself back in this restaurant if we return to the Monte Carlo again.   I also felt that it was a little on the expensive side for what you got.  Two typical eggs and meat meals, a side of oatmeal with coffee and with tip our bill was about $50.",2013-07-28,Las Vegas,-115.17466267299999,36.1047813604,"['Restaurants', 'Sandwiches', 'American (Traditional)', 'Cafes']"

4,RA Sushi Bar Restaurant,"Probably some of the best gyoza I've had.  Exceptional taste and a little crisp to it.  Only wish they had some chili oil and soy sauce.  I also tried the chicken katsu.  It wasn't the best but wasn't bad.  The reason for the four stars is the waitress was a wreck.  She spilled soy sauce all over the table when she first came to the table. Didn't clean it up just left a trail on the table.  It got all over the menu, table, glasses, everything.  I think half the container spilled out.  She only had two tables but seemed to give the impression she had 15.  Had to ask for rice with my chicken.  Thought that was a little 
weird.  Never got a refill on my drink and she didn't ask my wife if she wanted anything.  Had to stop her before she left the table to give her her order.  Is that asking too much?

5,China Tango,"I remember when this place first opened and I tried their food it was so delicious. 

First off, the place is always clean. The guy handling the money doesn't handle the food and vice versa. I never have to worry about looking for the table with the least amount if food left on it from previous guests, because the staff keep them clean.  

The staff there are very kind and are patient as i always want to try something different so I may take a few minutes to figure out what I want or if I actually want it. The same people are always there and the guy at the front knows what my co worker is going to order when we get there. If you dine in you get bottomless fried wonton noodles which are so good! They are also very quick; when you order, the food is out in less than ten minutes. 

Rice is a big thing with me as I feel it can make a meal taste great or make you want to throw it in the garbage, but can't cause that's a waste. The rice, both fried and steamed is very tasty and not dry which is one thing I hate about rice at other restaurants. Also the rice isn't mushy. I usually get sautéed vegetables and I don't want my meal to end. The vegetables are so fresh and crunchy and the sauce they use is so magnificent I love it! Their chow mien also tastes great and I'm not too much of a chow mien person.   

Lunch specials are very inexpensive and are reasonably portioned. I almost always have left overs. The time for the linch specials goes till 4p, so if you go close to that time, you can have dinner too!

Overall, I choose this place over any other Chinese place in the area and I've been to almost all of them. Can't beat the cleanliness, service, prices and of course the food!",2013-01-20,Henderson,-115.08583691,36.029537376,"['Restaurants', 'Chinese']"

1,Nobu Restaurant,"BAD. BAD.  REALLY BAD. Forget the price, forget the menu, the fish was not fresh. The dishes from the original restaurant have all been ""Vegas-ized"" with sugary catsup like stuff on the shishito peppers, and sweetened tofu that made it taste like a weird dessert. It was so disappointing for all of us. The tuna was passable, but the yellowtail was inedible, and the salmon not so hot either. We were all gagging by the end of the meal. 

This experience makes me question whether there is ANY fine cuisine in Vegas, or is it just a mall where all the culinary brands - banking on the ignorance caused by the beyond terrible general level of food in most of the US -- are making people feel like they are eating fine cuisine in huge portions  by designing the space luxuriously and charging 40 dollars for an entree and selling it in huge volume, while just industrializing the recipes and using low quality ingredients. Everything tastes like you are on a cruise. Yuck!

1,Dublin O'Neil's,"We have been a big fan of Dublin's but tonight the food was less than acceptable. We ordered the onion rings first and they were under fried and bland and very greasy.

However an order of the Ribeye was the worst ribeye ever ordered anywhere! Very thin piece of under quality steak that was grizzly and very hard to eat..asked for the manager and she was not accommodating..only offered another entree and we were not going to wait for another meal as we had been there for over an hour!!!

4,Wicked Six Bar & Grill,"This place was very nice and had BEAUTIFUL views. The food was delicious - we went for Easter brunch and it was a huge buffet. Everyone was very friendly.

Some critiques that need to be mentioned are as follows:
-It took them 20 mins to figure out that they needed to  put a chair to a table outside (we had made a reservation for noon outside and didn't get sat until 12:25). It was not busy at all and it made no sense what-so-ever.

-Everything was very slow, which is ok if you have boatloads of time on your hands. Luckily we did today. I would not recommend coming if you want a quick lunch.

-they seemed understaffed, our server didn't come back to check on us, we had to get up to ask for iced tea/water refills and for the check. She had a completely different section that was far away from our table. It just was very disorganized for a really nice restaurant.",2015-04-06,Fountain Hills,-111.7565281,33.605214399999994,"['Restaurants', 'American (New)', 'Food']"
2,LVH - Las Vegas Hotel & Casino,"Woooaaaahhh.  This place has changed, and not in a good way, since they lost the Hilton title.  

Some of the rooms are renovated.  They'll try to upsell you a renovated room when you get there.  The regular rooms are dated, but ok.  This isn't a 5 star strip hotel.  If you're here, you probably got a deal, or saw the dirt low price.  The resturaunts are good, and the buffet is average.  The sports book is maaaasssssiiivvveee.  

See that dirt-low price?  Yeah, so did everyone else.  The place is now loaded with lower-end people.  I saw two fights with security the last time I was there; one involving no less then 5 security officers. (Jan 2014)

So, yeah, the Fremont crowd found this hotel.  Friday and Sat nights is Latino club night; the band is actually good if your in a Spanish mood.

Wanting a pie, I hopped on the computer and ordered online.  Lots of deals online, I would recommend purchasing from here.  You can also track the production of your order from order to finish.

When the pizza arrived in under thirty minutes, I asked the delivery guy if they still had the 30 minutes or less policy.  He said they did not.....impressive!

Pur order consisted of a tasty two topper.  Everything tasted fresh and the crust was seasoned and not tasting like cardboard as I had previously remembered.

Dominio's has this thing they do with the chicken bites where they throw some toppings on them.  I ordered the tomato and bacon.  They were were delicious.

Now the bad news, this place is shady at best. They're suppose to have oxtails on Sundays. We went on Sunday and were told they didn't have any. No explanation given. We even went there once to get our kid a hamburger and were told they didn't have any even though they are on the menu. The service is hit or miss because many times we've overhead the servers and cooks loudly yelling at each other which is awkward and unprofessional for us patrons to observe. And just a few days ago we went to get take out only to he told that they were closing early because the cook/owner needed a beer! Huh! Also, we ordered collard greens and instead of simply telling us they were out ( which seems to be happening more and more as of late ) they simply added more mac and cheese without informing us. So, bottom line, if you can catch them, the food is great.

I have to say for cheap, 24 hour eats, Earl of Sandwich is recommended. Highly. The Full Montagu (Freshly Roasted Beef, Turkey, Aged Swiss & Sharp Cheddar, Lettuce, Roma Tomatoes & the Earl's Mustard Sauce) was a little over $6 and what sets it apart from other sandwiches is the bread. Light, airy, toasty exterior, delicious. And probably soaks up the alcohol in your stomach like a sponge.

3,Kandahar Kabab,"Wife and I were in the mood for kebabs about 2 weeks back (as of this writing).  It was late into the evening.  Still a lot of customers.  First time for afgan cuisine.  Price is a bit higher than we are used to however..for the portions we saw other customers chowing down on the prices seem justified.  Tho the price on their single kebabs could be a tad lower, 1 stick for over $4 bux seems a bit much.

We ordered take out since we wished to eat at home.  Tho we found out the portioning for take out vs dine-in was very different.  The chicken kebabs for us was very tasty.  We also enjoyed the yogurt dill sauce that was provided.  Their hot sauce had quite the kick for both of us.  It had us reaching for a glass of milk (we're not really into super spicy foods/dips) to quench the flames our taste buds were experiencing.

For future cravings of the kebabs we may opt to dine-in since the portioning is more.  Nothing really special to comment on their salad offering..might opt out on the salad on the next visit.

The only main advantage for us kebab wise, is that it is the closest one to us.  Haven't tried Bamiyan Kebab yet, but I have a friend who has recommended it.",2016-12-29,Toronto,-79.2423676,43.81254379999999,"['Afghan', 'Halal', 'Restaurants']"

The sub was lightly baked and didn't have the crunch and melted cheese I like. Again...it was ok..just not great. The pizza was light on anchovies and sauce for me. The crust was ok and the sauce was mediocre in flavor. 

After reading the reviews, perhaps I expected more. Everything was ""average"" in taste. They did load up the bacon so that was a plus. It was also very greasy.

Both our servers were very attentive, although they SHOULD be given that the 15% gratuity was automatically added to our bill!  Still, good service is not to be taken for granted these days and both servers were always very available, cheery and timely, even bringing refills for our soft drinks without even being prompted!  Appetizers and entrees were brought out in a reasonable time.  Quite an achievement as it was a typically busy Saturday night and the restaurant was jam-packed.  

Only complaint is that being a large and reputable chain, Jack Astor's SHOULD really take the initiative to offer much healthier fare.  I know that restaurants are not exactly conducive to sensible eating and are probably the wrong venue fir this expectation but as a health-conscious person who hates to derail her diet and lifestyle just because of dining out, I had checked the nutrition info prior to dining and had an insanely and frustratingly difficult time finding a healthy entree!  I am appalled that salads are ~500-600 calories, pastas/steaks are ~900-1200 calories and burgers/sandwiches are ~800-1000 calories!  This is disregarding the 3000 calories poutines!  Even entrees on the kids menu ranged from 500-800 calories!  Jack Astor's is in a great position to lead by example so I would really like to see more healthier offerings or at the very least a menu section that highlights food for health-conscious patrons with a calorie disclosure.  I have seen various forms of this in other restaurant chains so it is not asking the impossible.  In fact, that would definitely increase your business!

The large is only marginally bigger than the small and we all had to go to MacDonald's next door afterwards as the servings, even the large is not filling enough.

Let's start with restaurant itself:
It was my first time here and I expected a small, quiet, ""hole in the wall"" type of restaurant. To my surprise it was quite large and beautifully decorated. It had a very nice view and a lot of natural light. My friends who don't usually go downtown were just mesmerized by the view of the city. But to most it might not be all that special. Nonetheless, still very nice. 

The service:
I had a really nice waiter whose name I can't remember. He was very patient with us seeing as how it took us a bit long to decide what we wanted. He constantly checked up on us throughout the meal and he was very welcoming. He even brought us bread at the beginning which wasn't on the menu. He catered to our every need. 

The food:
Since it we ordered from the winterlicious menu, we each got an app, a main, and dessert. I had the caesar salad to start which was good considering I usually don't like Caesar dressing. The croutons were also very nice. For the main I had the ""surf and turf"" which was a 10oz steak (which is what attracted me to the restaurant!), a jumbo shrimp, seasonal vegetables, with a choice or mashed/baked potatoes, fries, or rice I believe. I had the fries. I asked for a rare steak and one of my friends ordered a blue steak and they were cooked to perfection. Most places tend to over cook it when asked for blue or rare. The fries were also very good; not too salty which I find is usually the case.  I'm not a fan of shirmp but it was a nice touch. The flavours on it were very good. For dessert we all had the creme brûlée . It was my first time trying creme brûlée and I must say it left a good first impression for it. It had a crisp top and coconut flakes. 

Overall it was a great experience and I will definitely go back whether or not it's winterlicious.",2015-02-05,Toronto,-79.3737343383,43.6488195575,"['Restaurants', 'Bars', 'Italian', 'Venues & Event Spaces', 'Breakfast & Brunch', 'Cafes', 'Caterers', 'Event Planning & Services', 'Nightlife']"
5,Café Havana,"I just tried out Cafe Havana - this was my first time having Cuban food, and I had seen the Cuban Sandwich in the movie Chef and wanted to try it out. My Husband and I both got the Cuban sandwich and a pop. The wait time was short, and the sandwiches were on our table within minutes. 

I should note here that I am a life-long hater of mustard. I've never liked it, not on anything. The Cuban sandwich comes with roasted pork, ham, mozzarella cheese, pickles and mustard, and I was aware of that, but decided to give it a go anyway.

Oh my lord, I'm glad I did. It was one DELICIOUS sandwich. First off, it's a HUGE sandwich, we definitely didn't need a side. The pickles and mustard were perfectly paired with the bread and the pork. The pork smelled so delicious while it was cooking, my mouth was watering. It was such a large portion, I couldn't even finish it and took the rest home.

One of the owners, a very nice Cuban lady, was the one who delivered our sandwiches. We told her it was our first time trying Cuban food, and she suggested trying the tamale, which came with roasted pork on it. We took her up on it, and my Husband was moaning with delight as he ate the corn tamale - he LOVED it. It was SO good.

For 2 sandwiches, the large tamale and 2 pops, our total came to $36, which is a very reasonable price, especially for Oakville. We will definitely be coming back for more Cubanos from Cafe Havana, and next time, I think we'll try out the Yucca and the Plantains. :)",2015-08-13,Oakville,-79.7263592,43.431756799999995,"['Cuban', 'Restaurants']"
4,The Cheesecake Factory,"Had a really good meal at this Cheesecake Factory last night.  We went with a large group of ten and our server did a FANTASTIC job of being attentive and keeping everything straight; even keeping track of 4 different checks without a hitch.  I had the miso salmon which I tend to enjoy at most Cheesecake Factorys but last nights was especially good.  The salmon was perfectly cooked and flavorful.  Most of our party enjoyed their meals.  There was a small hiccup when one of our meals had what looked like brillo in it but it turned out to be charred corn silk.  The server and manager were very professional and took care of it by quickly expediting a new one as well as taking it off the bill.

3,Todd English P.U.B.,"I have been here a couple of times on different visits to Vegas and both times I left well satisfied but not necessarily wowed. On both occasions hubby and I ordered the pickled vegetables which are really delicious though with their strong flavor they can be a bit much. I recommend ordering them with a group. Last time we got something from ""the carvery"" which is also a good option for sharing. Our last visit we were there too late for a big meal so we just stuck to appetizers and drinks. In addition to the pickles we got some wings and the corn dog bites. Both were pretty tasty.

Of course being a pub most people come to Todd English's to drink and that is where they really shine. Their list of craft beers is stellar. I really like the fact that they have a description of each one on the menu. That makes me more confident to try new ones. However, that also seems to be a crutch for the staff since our server was not familiar with them at all. We actually had to point at the ones we wanted while he wrote them down. Other than that he was pretty good but not overly friendly. We were there during March madness so there was a lively crowd clustered around the tv but the rest of the place was pretty mellow. I think this would be a good option for some late night drinks since they have a reverse happy hour from 10pm to midnight (yes, that is late for me) and a lot of bars and even restaurants on the strip get way too clubby for my taste at that hour.

Overall this place is a Vegas style (i.e. cheesy knockoff but still cool in its own way) approximation of a British pub and even though the food does not impress, it is decent. One of the cheaper options in City Center for lunch or dinner. A better choice for hanging out over drinks with friends.",2013-04-14,Las Vegas,-115.17358300000001,36.108808200000006,"['Beer', 'Wine & Spirits', 'Nightlife', 'Bars', 'Gastropubs', 'Food', 'Restaurants', 'British']"

Overall, this place has a great vibe to have a latte with friends but comes up just short of making a good latte.",2014-06-04,Phoenix,-111.99663161299999,33.4376595923,"['Restaurants', 'Cafes']"
1,Oregano's Pizza Bistro,"I had not been to an Oregano's in like 10 years. They seems to be popping up all over here in AZ now so my buddy was in from out of town and he wanted to try, so why not.

I'll tell you ""Why NOT""... we has two thin crust pizzas... and I even hate to call them that. More like... crackers with melted cheese and some toppings.

That was some of the worst excuse for pizza I've ever had. Most of the fast-food delivery pizza I've had beats it -- and I do not like, at all, delivery pizza.

Maybe the pan pizza is better than the thin crust... god it could not be worse!

It only deserves one star for the good service... other than that is the another sub-par overpriced ""gourmet"" pizza joint.

4,The Keg Steakhouse + Bar,"I love the keg and have been here several times. I have ordered everything from the Filet Mignon to the Teriyaki chicken, to a plain ol salad and have never been disappointed in the wait staff or my meal.

I gotta say the bread they give is AH-MAZ-ING. It comes out pipping hot fresh from the oven, covered in a black cloth to keep warm and sided with a delicious moose butter. I could fill up on their bread alone. In fact, I have asked for more bread to have with my meal and they brought it at no extra charge.

If you have a special request, they are always willing to accommodate. One time I went in, I wanted their mandarin cranberry walnut salad made into a dinner portion (not the small side one they have on the menu) and I wanted chicken on it. Not a problem. I have to say that is one of the best salads  I have been served at a restaurant. 

Their blue cheese Filet Mignon is outright RICH. With a side of those garlic mashed potatoes, it will send you over the top. I can't see how nayone can finish it.

The keg is also great with reservations and will take them even if its just you and 1 other person. The wait here can get a bit long if you show up after 630. I always make reservations to be better safe than hungry.

Like another yelper mentioned, this is not a Ruth's Chris steak house, this is the Keg. A notch under the best, but for the price and the great food, you can't beat it.",2009-04-29,Tempe,-111.90712451899999,33.4325515877,"['Steakhouses', 'Seafood', 'Bars', 'Nightlife', 'Restaurants']"
3,Excellent Bbq House,"Excellent BBQ is a tad out of my way for Chinese BBQ.  It's a bit pricey and just not drive 20 minutes out of my way worthy.  Don't get me wrong, there's absolutely nothing wrong with Excellent BBQ.  Indeed it is fairly Excellent, and if you're near by, it's probably an okay regular place.

My defining meat for all Chinese BBQ places is the roasted pork.  Do they find quality pigs and is the skin done just right?  That means not burnt, and not underdone or have been sitting there so long that it's rubbery.  It's got to be the consistency of potato chips.

Excellent BBQ, passed the piggy test, but just wasn't as flavourful with the other marinades with their soya chicken and roasted duck.

We to decided to split the tasting platter which included a chicken enchilada, beef burrito & choice of quesadilla or tamalito on the side. We went with the quesadilla. Our food took an unusually long time to arrive, I'd say at least a good half hour.

4,The Other Place,"It was only after they descended the stairs to the bar area that Joe realised he was ducking his head. A full week had passed since a section of the ceiling had fell away - mere days after opening - only to be repaired within a matter of hours. Obviously the story had stuck in his mind but looking around he could see the staff buzzing about a hive of tables, most occupied by friends and lovers, lost in conversation

The Other Place was very much back in business.

Feeling a little foolish, and hoping Jennie hadn't noticed, he straightened up and they took their seats; a small, round, European-influenced table, far enough from the patio doors to avoid the glare of the sun yet close enough to appreciate the cooling breeze that whipped by outside.

Almost instantly they were greeted by their waitress, a petit and cheerful girl with an accent that served to echo their surroundings. They placed the usual drinks order: a white wine (large) for her; a Jack and Coke (Diet) for him.

Typically they discussed the events that had momentarily staggered the Other Place's opening week. Looking up, they could easily differentiate between old and new ceilings. The largest flat section was now a spread of grey mortar, but all the rest retained its classic elegance. There were three sections over the bar area in all, chandeliers hung centrally from all, but the older two also held circular mirrors that rounded the light fixtures, and the detailed cornicing, with its ornate engravings, were captivating.

A moment later Joe spotted their drinks, albeit atop a waiter's tray that was headed the wrong way. The waiter seemed not to know where the beverages were destined to be but Joe certainly did and intervened just as the waitress with the accent pointed out their table.

The summer weather had drawn an unexpected crowd, or so it seemed from the tables that had been amassed inside. This by no means made their stay uncomfortable but the impromptu table layout was obviously leading the waiting staff a merry chase as a result. Spirits were high and the waiter made his apologies by way of some charming banter, which they both appreciated.

Then their waitress returned. ""Ready to order?"" she said with an enthusiastic smile.

""Absolutely,"" Joe replied. ""If the portion is big enough, we'd like to share the Spicy Shrimp and Chorizo starter...?""

He glanced at Jennie as he spoke, her cool green eyes glittering thoughtfully as if she was trying to calculate how much food she might manage, before she confirmed his choice with a nod.

Joe smiled appreciatively, ""And for mains...?"" He gestured to his partner to take the lead.

""I'll have the Chilli Cheese Dog with extra Fried Onions,"" Jennie said, decisively.

""And for me, the Juicy Lucy with the Hash Brown topping.""

While they waited for their first course, they took in the place. Beforehand it had been an old gentleman's public house, with a name involving a Stag or some other woodland creature no doubt. The transformation was impressive; the room in which they sat now the bar area, while the upper level housed the open-face kitchen, artfully circled by an array of stools for those who wished to watch their food being prepared.

The bar itself was rather impressive too, Art Deco in style - much like the majority of the decor and furnishings - with a vast selection of bourbons and rums, whiskies and wines on display. Joe had heard rumour they stocked 100 various beers and ales back there too.

The Shrimp and Chorizo dish could not have been any better. A perfect sharing dish, but good enough to make Joe wish he'd bought his own. The shrimp soft and delicate, the chorizo veritably haemorrhaging flavour; it needed to be tried to be believed. Joe initially added the romantic touch of sharing the dish with the same fork, however he had clearly forgotten how slowly Jennie tended to eat, so - once he'd tasted that chorizo - snapped up the spare fork with fervour.

Equally so, they enjoyed their mains. The Chilli Dog as messy animal indeed, and Jennie used her cutlery wisely, albeit to Joe's horror (few things in this world must be eaten by hand but both burgers and hotdogs are at the apex of that list). The chilli itself, which they had experienced once before, was interesting in that it closer resembled pulled pork, but in no way was that a criticism; it was delightful.

The burger patty was handmade, and clearly so as it crumbled juicily with each bite. Stuffed with subtle cheese and topped with a flaky hash brown, his only gripe was that the latter was under-seasoned. Despite that negative, he made a note to contact all his friends on the quest for Edinburgh's Best Burger to take note of The Other Place.

The meal had been a test. A test of the Other Place and what they were bringing to the capital. A test of how they intended to compete with neighbouring Stockbridge without being as wanky. A test of why they could justify some of the prices on their menu.

It was test they passed.",2013-07-18,Edinburgh,-3.1963183377999997,55.962520766400004,"['Nightlife', 'Pubs', 'Scottish', 'Brasseries', 'Gastropubs', 'Restaurants', 'Bars']"

Was könnte schöner sein, als nach einem warmen Sommertag die kühlen Abendstunden im Freien zu verbringen? Gestern waren wir auf Empfehlung von Freunden im griechischen Restaurant ARGO auf der Neckarinsel. Glücklicherweise stellten sich auch Hunger und Durst schnell ein.
Wir begannen mit 2 warmen Vorspeisen gegrillter Halloumi mit Chili und Auberginen mit Schafskäse in Tomatensoße. Nach einer ausreichenden Pause haben wir eine geschmorte Lammkeule mit grünen Bohnen mit größtem Vergnügen gegessen. Griechischer Kaffee und griechischer Jogurt mit frischem Obst haben später das ""kleine"" Nachtmahl komplettiert. 
Das Essen war frisch, lecker und angenehm gewürzt (frische Kräuter und geschmacks-intensives Olivenöl).
Auf Empfehlung des Chefs haben wir zunächst ein weißes Cuvee aus den Rebsorten Sauvignon Blanc und Assyrtiko getrunken, zum Lamm gab es dann ein vorzügliches rotes Cuvee aus Syrah, Merlot und Xynomavro. 
Service und Speisen aber auch die mit viel Fachwissen präsentierten Weine haben einen bleibenden Eindruck hinterlassen.

They have special areas to keep the infants and toddlers safe, but the staff and absentee parents do nothing to enforce these rules, so you've got 8 year old children body slamming each other from piled up couch cushions and blindly hopping over walls where babies are crawling around.

4,Indulge Burgers & More,"First of all, can Yelp afford to give 1/2 stars?  The better question is, why CAN'T Yelp(!) afford 1/2 stars?  I might have given the extra 1/2 star, but for no reason at all, Yelp won't allow me that option.  I cannot believe that.  Of course Yelp must think this page is perfect and cannot be interrupted.  I disagree.

I finally made it to Indulge and let me just say, I indulged.  Whoa.  The visuvio burger was great.  Moist, a damned good burger.  {Note to self: a few criticisms: 
1)wheat bun wasn't good.  It's tough and not tasty.  Ok, next time I'll try another kind of bun but the wheat bun wasn't ""my bad choice"", it was just bad.
2) if I order mushrooms on the burger, who said I wanted mushrooms on the side?  Mustard, ketchup, mayo...same thing.  Ordered it, wanted it, PUT IN ON THE DAMNED BURGER!!!   I want it ON THE BURGER!   But that's just me.  I could be wrong.}

What DID impress me the most here wasn't even the burger I was eating.  It was what the guy next to me was eating.  Seriously.  Here I was, eating a really immense burger, juicy, delicious but what kept catching my eye was the Salmon Salad the guy was eating next to me.  And it didn't help that he was savoring EVERY SINGLE BITE..

And a joint that's friendly, clean (very), can do a fabulous gigumbo burger...AND a delicious looking Salmon Salad, that's a good joint.

4,Z'Tejas Southwestern Grill,"I usually don't write a lot about chain restaurants, but this particular Z'Tejas deserves one from me!

I think over Z'Tejas serves up some good eats in general.  I particularly love their cheese dip in their nacho cheese and chip appetizer.  Warm, creamy, and cheesy along with some guacamole pop; great start to the night and I would totally recommend.  They're known for their margaritas, but I felt like a beer so didn't have a chance, but definitely next time!  

For entrees my friend and I shot for the Salmon salad, fajitas, and for myself I ordered the Smothered Chicken Burrito.  I rather enjoyed my burrito filled with rice, chicken, cheese, and doused with warm red chile sauce.  

However, the love I give here is because of their service.  We had a party of 11 and they did their best to accommodate us on a busy night; even having a server come out to the front of the building taking our drink orders.  Service did not slack all night and that's what I appreciate; plus they were knowledgeable about their food.

5,Golden Gate Chinese Restaurant,"It's great to walk into a restaurant recommended by Yelpers and get the feeling that it is going to be a good meal.  Traditional chinese decor without being gaudy.  Quickly treated to free tea and  served crispy, fresh, non-greasy noodles.  How attentive!  Even the table has the traditional condiments right on it (soy sauce, real-hot mustard, duck sauce).  Nowadays you have to ask for these as restaurants are cutting down, and the mustard is not the great strong Chinese mustard--it is a watered down type.  Ordered soups: egg drop which had bits of chicken in it and wonton.  The egg drop was very good and the broth of the wonton soup was delicious--the wontons lacked meat inside or at least one of the wonton did not have meat but for $2.25 each I cannot complain about a thing! 
Ordered Schezehan chicken,chicken fried rice and shrimp with lobster sauce.  I wanted to try the shrimp with lobster sauce after the fiasco I experienced at Qwik Chinese Bistro in Scottsdale.  You can read the details in that review.  This one did not let me down.  12 large shrimp in a nice, non-sweet sauce with water chestnuts.  Lovely and delicious.  Made me forget about the prior fiasco.  The chicken fried rice was a large, delicious plate of a multi-ingredient rice. Wow, and they added bean sprouts which i think really makes it even better.  The Schezuhan chicken was made without breading and spicy just as he ordered it.  What a great meal this was.  With our check came the typical fortune cookies AND as a bonus, wontons filled with mashed bananas with powered sugar.  These were better than you might expect.  Such a simple treat and yet so delicious.  They didn't have to do this but they did.  The service was spot-on without being overbearing.  I had to bag up the shrimp and lobster sauce that's how large the portion was.
BTW, pricing is very reasonable and the service was impeccable.

I haven't been back since and truthfully; with the amount of amazing restaurants in Toronto that understand how important great food and impeccable service is... why would I choose to go back to Colette? My reasoning for the 2 star rating is because the Parisan interior of the restaurant is absolutely stunning, and the sommelier is very knowledgeable. Also, the food is decent but very overpriced for what it is.  If you need a last minute last resort dinner option this will do the trick, just don't expect anything incredible.

I've never really had Cambodian food before so I cannot say that I am an expert but I do know Thai, Chinese and Vietnamese, so I'm also not totally naive. 

The restaurant is small with only around 10 tables. This means that you may have to wait. Luckily we had a reservation since there were 8 of us and only one large table. The servers there are very nice and know the menu well as stated in past reviews. They are also very helpful to ask for opinions or recommendations if you think the menu looks a little intimidating. 

The food was very good. We really enjoyed the chicken wings and had several noodle dishes that I cannot remember the name of. We also had the beef skewers which I thought was find but my wife did not care for it. All in all it was a good ""secret"" place for a well priced meal.

I called.  I called.  I called.  YOU NEVER CALLED ME BACK.  Messages ""were taken"" - my 24/7 cell phone number was left with my messages.  When I asked the message taker to repeat my number to me I was told ""I have it... no problem"" and they hung up.  WHICH MEANS - 9 times out of 10, they NEVER WROTE IT DOWN!!!!  I was probably speaking to you.  And that's when I contacted home office.  YOU CAN NOT IGNORE PEOPLE - and if you do - you lose business and customers.  LIVE WITH YOUR DECISION.....  

I can't believe the home office even allows you to use their name.  This is a huge HUGE reflection on their part.  As well as trying to talk with me about the problems we encountered.  Blasting me on Yelp --- it's AMERICA bud - and I can say what I want and when I want too. 

Everything I said was TRUE - Believe it or not.  I don't care.  But other people out there WILL CARE - infact - check out my wall.  Two friends read my review of your crappy service and cold food and said they would NOT NOT NOT ever eat there.

I hope your doors close - you deserve it.

Laura,
We responded to your complaint on September 3rd you never reached out to us but you did reach out to yelp to post a negative not true review.You then wrote the general office telling them we never reached out to which we then provided a copy of our email to you. The email is obviously correct because you just emailed us and I am again responding to you. I found your review to be very incorrect and out of line on the truth and again you just posted another review stating we never contacted you which isn't true. I will not respond again to you after your fraudulent review you have posted yet again and will contact yelp with the appropriate documentation on why your review is fraudulent. If you would like to take down your review and discuss with us then the issue you have with our place we will then be happy top do so.

3,BRGR,"Located in the South Hills at the Galleria where Dragonfire grill used to be. The decor is modern rustic looking. Very clean as you would hope for anywhere but especially at a new restaurant. 

This was my first time at a BRGR. I thought the menu was small compared to most restaurants in general but the focus is obviously the burger. After reviewing the few non burger choices, it became clear that a burger is what you are supposed to do. You can create your own by choosing toppings, bun, type of meat, etc. This could get pricey though because you pay for each item. I had the turkey burger (pictured) which was very good and I would happily have again. Their ""crack mac"" was tasty but underwhelming and not that special in my opinion. 

Burgers don't come with any sides, they are all al la carte but big enough to probably share between people. 

Bottom line, I thought it was good and would go back but I wasn't really blown away. I think you could get an equally satisfying burger somewhere else.",2015-02-09,Pittsburgh,-80.05209509999999,40.357213,"['Restaurants', 'Burgers']"

3,Chipotle Mexican Grill,"I've been to this location about 3 times now, the first two times were great...this last time not so much. First off, the hours on Yelp say they're open at 10:30 during the week so that's when I got there. Turns out they don't open till 10:45. As I was waiting  a bunch of the workers were having lunch outside...which is cool and all but I mean make sure your place of service is ready to go when it's time to open (I'll get to this later)...so at around 10:45 they let me in through the side door and as I wait another 5 minutes for the line staff to be ready they offer me a free drink. Finally I get to order and I paid , about ready to leave...I was about to ask for some lemons but they forgot to unlock the front door and a customer was waiting to get in. So he goes and unlocks the door and I asked him for lemon when he got back. He goes to grab the lemons and grabs a whole one out and says ""hold on I have to go cut it up"" and goes and cuts the lemon with NO gloves on and proceeds to stuff it in a container with juice dripping everywhere... at this point I was just frustrated and wanted to get the hell out of there after waiting an extra 20 minutes past their hours on Yelp displayed. I have to say I really enjoyed this location before today. They usually are pretty good about things so I'm giving them the benefit of the doubt.

Let alone the spice, the noodles had no shrimp (which I did order) and it had absolutely no peanut sauce. It was just a big bowl of plain noodles which I could have made in my house with some chicken.


2. Panang curry

5,Durant's,"Last night was my 2nd time dining here, and it was glorious.  Starting the night off by walking in through the kitchen always reminds me of GoodFellas, and that's a good thing.  I happen to like the old school signage / decor, it adds character to a restaurant that has been in the same spot for 60+ years.  

They were busy, so it took a while to get drink / appetizer orders, but it wasn't unreasonable.  The only appetizer we got was the spinach-artichoke dip, and it was one of the best I've had.  My wife, my muse, got the wedge salad and it was fresh and also delicious.  I shared the 48 oz. porterhouse with my friend, and let me say that when a hunk of meat that big comes to the table you have to just appreciate the art that it takes to cook it so perfectly.  We got the mushrooms and the potatoes au gratin on the side, which were ideal compliments.  

After getting the rest of what we couldn't finish to go, the waiter recommended the strawberry shortcake.  We were all full, but the four of us split - and was quite possibly one of the finest and tastiest desserts ever.  The only drawback, in my opinion, are the tiny, outdated bathrooms - but that's not a dealbreaker.

2,Jamie's Italian Square One,We arrived at this location on a weekend back in July and it was around 4:40 pm when we arrived. We asked to be seated at the patio and we were seated immediately. So far so good. We were handed our menus and the server walked away.  I noticed that they had a drink special up until 5 PM for a lower price then the regular. Since we still had 15 minutes before the special was up we thought we would get it. We waited and waited for our server to take our drink orders and she didn't come back until 5:02 PM. We asked if we could get the special and she said its past 5 so the discount doesn't apply anymore. And I said well we got here before 5 and waited for someone to take our drink orders and waited for 15 minutes. The server just gave an apology but still said she couldn't do anything about it. At this point we were pretty pissed. The only thing that got us not to get up and leave was that I was very hungry so had to stick around to grab food. Since we waited for so long we gave our drink and food order at the same time. Didn't want to wait separately for both because we could tell the service was going to be slow. One of the things we ordered was the crab and avocado bruschetta. It had no flavour and I couldn't even taste the avocado. Also ordered the Jamie Italian burger. The burger was excellent but due to their service i will NOT be coming back to the Mississauga location.,2016-09-07,Mississauga,-79.6423131918,43.591608381499995,"['Desserts', 'Italian', 'Food', 'Pizza', 'Restaurants']"
2,B and B Ristorante,"Underwhelming food and experience. We were a party of three and dined there last night. Expectations were high given the name behind this spot and the usually high standards of the Venetian. The Beet salad appetizer started great - simple, refreshing and excellent flavors. However main courses were mediocre at best. Sirloin steak was dry, came with Arugula and about as much balsamic as fits on the tip of your finger. Absolutely no taste to this dish. My friend's Quail was over cooked and overall plate was just poorly combined. Our other companions Linguine was deemed very good. The biscotti plate and Americano coffee were the best part of the meal.

Service was well below what we are used to from the Venetian businesses. Waiter was friendly enough but didn't hide the fact that he didn't give a shit about anything. Pinot Grigio was served after the appetizers arrived and his reaching over our plates to pick up a thing or two through out the meal made me want to slap his wrist.

Overall I feel this place is poorly managed and overblown. Won't be back.",2016-06-06,Las Vegas,-115.168725629,36.1230025089,"['Restaurants', 'Italian', 'Seafood']"

Food is spicier that Kama but only mild so need not worry. Naan is very good too. Service was a bit slower in terms of taking our used plates but I don't mind taking them near to their kitchen.

4,Pomegranate Cafe,"I have now been to Pom Cafe maybe 4-5 times.  There are numerous interesting dishes on the menu, and most of the dishes are heaping with food, so the prices are not that bad.  The veggies are fresh and delicious, and I love the hummus.  I've also ordered some of the rice and tofu and was impressed, although it could have been a bit more spicy.  I've ordered the hummus with bagel that also comes with veggie chips - very filling and tasty.  I need to branch out and order more things the next times I visit.  One of my friends is picky and vegan, and she now frequents this place quite often.  I recently ordered a salad with kale, and whatever the dressing that was on the kale was the most delicious dressing I have tasted in a while!  I have also ordered a veggie wrap with the ""cheese"" made from nuts (I think).  It was deliciously flavorful and interesting. The flax crackers that came with it weren't really enough, maybe 25 kcal worth. I also have tried their sweet stuff, and the homemade granola bars and cheesecake bites are fresh and tasty. 

The staff members are always friendly and happy to chat for a few minutes when picking up orders or trays. 

There are a few things that could make the place even better.  If it's busy, be prepared to wait for a while for the food.  Sometimes the portions are big and then sometimes they are small. I was expecting a deliciously large veggie plate like last time (normal size plate) but instead got a cake-sized plate with maybe 1/2 cup veggies  and hummus.  Also, some items are pre-mixed, and peppers make me rather sick. I have to pick them out or order something else.  Sometimes, or often, things are forgotten in an order, so make sure to check before leaving. 

Pomengranate has expanded the menu since my review in August or whenever, and they now have dinner.

5,El Dorado Cantina,"We almost turned around when our GPS took us to Sapphire Gentleman's Club, but the restaurant and club share a roof.  We had a great night, aside from the doorman at the club saying, ""Hi, glen"" which I had to nervously shrug off. 

You'll likely be amazed to see such a spacious and attractive spot (dimly lit, very dark red and black, very Dave Navarro's bedroom) next to a strip club, full of couples, groups, and families, packed even on a Monday night.  And no poles.

Service was very good at the bar.  The award-winning menu was creative but maybe too fancy for some folk (i.e. you won't find the #2 two hard shell tacos, refried beans and rice).  The two complimentary homemade salsas were too runny and smoky for the chips, but perfect for the food, especially on the yummy chorizo and egg burrito with thick homemade potato chips. Clean, strong, but pricey margaritas... mmm pineapple margarita.

You share the sides, and we normally go with a large party so we are able to order mac/cheese (which is the favorite), spinach with egg, mushrooms, and a bunch of others. My favorite appetizer is the tuna tartare.

There was a good amount of meat included, but I have been to other places that had more. The clientele seemed to be mostly asian, which I guess is a good endorsement.

2,Destihl Restaurant & Brew Works,"I'm so disappointed. 
I'm in champaign visiting my sister, and a friend of ours recommended we go to Destihl. He touted it as a gift from the gods. Like so good hat he went there for lunch and dinner one day and then came back for brunch the next morning. After looking at the menu, how could I resist??
So we went today for a late lunch (around 2:30) and found the place pretty much deserted. There were some people working in the bar who made eye contact with us but didn't come up to the host stand to seat us. So we waited. And waited. And finally a hostess came and brought us to a cavernous booth in the bar. Where we waited. And waited. And listened to awful terrible music (read: Dave Matthews Band)
A female server came to get our drink orders and informed us that Michael would be our server. Ok, so the do team service, I'm on board with that. But Michael didn't come with our drinks. Someone dressed like a manager did. And Michael didn't take our food order. A woman who we later learned was a manager did. I think Michael maybe refilled our drinks? The first manager looking guy dropped off our apps. Here's the skinny on what we had:
Beer battered bacon: this is worth a star. It was greasy but oddly delicious. 
Brussels sprouts: flavor was good but they were still pretty hard in the middle. 
Bacon Egg and Cheese Deviled Eggs: nothing to write home about. They were small and pretty smoky tasting. 
 For entrees, I ordered the fried egg BLT and my sister ordered the bison burger. My BLT was fine. Again, nothing to write home about. There was some sort of mustardy vinaigrette on the greens that was overpowering. And the egg could have been runnier. But another star goes to the fries which were hot and crispy and delicious. 
My sister ordered her burger medium and it came out completely well done. Like ""we think this bison is dead but let's burn it at the stake just to make sure it's really really dead."" She decided to send it back and so we waited. And waited. And a brand new server (still not Michael) came by to check on us. She went back to the kitchen to have them make a new burger and left the old one so my sis could nibble on the fries. Her friendly attitude and apologies would have garnered another star, but I was SO put off when she came back to tell us that her manager wanted to let us know that she put the order in correctly and that the cooks are the ones who screwed up. Umm... Why wouldn't the manager come over herself to apologize? Or at least to check on us after the replacement came? And also, it is so not cool to throw your kitchen staff under the bus like that. 
All in all, Destihl has good bacon, inattentive staff, poor leadership, and too much desire to be ""cool."" And where is Michael? My receipt says he was my server but I don't even know if I saw him, and I fear my tip went to someone who didn't do any work!

The main course consisted of beef and broccoli and shrimp curry fried rice. Both were average and really nothing special about this meal. The wait staff were on top of everything with the one exception that I had to practically beg for a second glass of wine. 

One last note, and I may have the wrong restaurant, but I really enjoyed this place about a year ago and they provided a complimentary shot of Bailey's and fortune cookie at the end of the meal (sounds silly, but I was actually looking forward to it).

1,Jean Georges Steakhouse,"Unbelievably poor showing from a Jean Georges establishment - the service was indifferent, the food was tasteless (especially the sides), and the worst offense?  My steak was ice cold when it arrived at the table.  After waiting for almost an hour and a half for our entrees to arrive, that sad slab of NY strip was just intolerable.  

Similarly disappointing: the quality of the ingredients they serve - they list their steaks as ""prime"" on the menu, but they're  wet-aged (not dry aged), a fact that is only revealed if you hound your waiter to admit it.  The lobster is rock lobster from Australia.  Hello?  We have perfectly amazing lobster in the States - it comes from Maine and it's far superior.  Last but not least:  Australian ""Wagyu"" (or ""wayygoo,"" as our waitress kept misstating) is not, in fact, the real McCoy.  These days you have to travel to Japan and/or have some serious import connections to find actual Kobe beef.

2,Osaka Japanese Bistro Summerlin,"Horrible service, decent food.

My family went to dinner here on a Tuesday night around 730pm. Me, my spouse, my toddler, and my infant. We had a gift card for $50, and decided to use $40-ish and apply the rest as tip. You have the choice of sitting at the sushi bar, the teppanyaki grill/tables, or a regular table. We opted for the regular table since we had the kids. 

They do have high chairs, which is nice! The grill-folk do high-fire tricks and a lot of spatula clanging, so if you have a skiddish toddler... probably not the right place to go unless you enjoy eating with a two year old sitting on your head. The seating in the regular table area was a bit awkward. Giant chairs on wheels that you sink into. The waitress chooses that moment as I am weirdly scooting back in while trying not to sink through to the floor to come up and greet us.

She was nice enough, bubbly and friendly. That, however, is the only positive comment to be had about the service. Snail paced is the best phrase to use in regards to food preparation and delivery. 
-15 minutes till we got to order and got our drinks.
-15 minutes for the appetizer (chicken katsu, which was pretty good. crunchy and well seasoned). 
-30 minutes for dinner (2 chicken teriyaki bento boxes. chicken was good. came with a huge portion of tempura shrimp and veggies. very reasonable for $15 or so). 
-30 minutes for the check (I asked if I could use the remaining $9 and change as tip and was told that I could not and would have to take the remainder as a new gift card).
-15 minutes for a piece of banana cheese cake in a box (ordered this because I didn't want a $9 giftcard sitting around. when they finally brought it to me, it was a mushy pile that had been thrown in a box. picture added here to show the cafeteria style glop that was $8).
20 minutes for change (because I could not leave the tip, I had to break a $100 bill. I asked for a $10, a $5, and five $1 somewhere in the mix of that change. I received a $50, a $10, and some $20. So I had to wait an additional 5 minutes while I flagged someone down to get the appropriate change. All this for a tip that in the end I probably should have not even bothered to give! Maybe I should have left my banana glop as a tip). 

Over 2 hours for 3 and 1/2 star food and a box of banana cheesecake baby food mash is a bit much for me and my family. Thank goodness we didn't order anything complicated, we would probably still be sitting there waiting!!! 

I have tried to call 3 times on different days at different times to talk to a manager about the appalling service, have left my name and number each time. Have not spoken to her yet. I was told ""if she doesn't call you, just keep trying"". I find that exceptionally odd. I am trying to let you know about crappy service, and you are not calling me back. Gee, I wonder where your staff get their laid back barely working attitude from. I was trying to wait until I had spoken with her to make this post, but that patience has passed.",2012-07-05,Las Vegas,-115.257341096,36.1956731299,"['Restaurants', 'Sushi Bars', 'Japanese']"
5,Zarra's A Taste of Southern Italy,"We first ate at Zarra's about 5 years ago, and we were immediately impressed by the food. My husband is Italian and his mother is an incredible cook, so we have high standards when it comes to Italian food. I had the Cavatelli con Polo Primavera di Judith and it was fantastic. That dish remains one of my favorites followed by the Linguine di Contosta with the spicy ""palmieri"" tomato sauce. I love red sauce, and can't believe how many different types of red sauce they make here, each more flavorful than the next.  My husband has worked his way through most of the menu, and his favorites include the Polenta Calabrese, Pasta e Fagoli and Cavatelli e Verdure di Rena. There are so many good dishes it's hard to pick a few to recommend! We may have started to go there because of the food but we remain loyal customers because of the people. Each time you dine at the restaurant it is as if you are being welcomed into the home of the Zarra family, and it's a place you don't want to leave anytime soon. Johnny, Judy, Donny and Jamie, as well as their entire staff make you feel welcomed and it's truly the best place to relax after a long work week (or work day!). We grew to love Zarra's so much, we even had our rehearsal dinner there, and our family is still talking about that night.

4,The Blind Pig,"I like the lounge-feel interior of this place. Bricks, plush seats, curtains and interesting ceiling. They have a pantry where they have beer, wine and other libations as well as items you'd find in some pantries (fig almond cake, Nutella, pasta, real mustard, red pepper tapenade, etc.). They have Veuve and Moet! They have a deli section which has orzo pasta, couscous, salads, sandwiches, cheesecake, monkey bread, brownies, cookies (chocolate protein cookies even!), Nutella pound cake, and other desserts. Then, there's the bar and dining area. On the menu they have: appetizers, pizza, sandwiches, salads, pasta, steak frites, shrimp and lobster mac and cheese, salmon, ahi tuna, roasted chicken, smoothies and coffee.

Chocolate Hazelnut Verrine:
This has got to be my Blind Pig favorite. Layers of delicious light chocolate mousse and sweet, nutty and crunchy brittle. 5/5

Orzo Pasta:
It has a tiny bit of a tang and minty-ness - just enough to make it taste interesting. The texture is just right. It has olives, red onions and tiny bits of feta. 4/5

Nutella Pound Cake:
I love pound cake and to add Nutella to to the batter is pure enjoyable madness! It's filling and delicious. Buttery cake with sweet chocolate hazelnut swirls. 5/5

Shrimp and Lobster Roll:
I got this with a side of French fries. They use Oreida frozen fries - booooo! This had no flavor. The roll was toasted but it has no butter - maybe, they're health conscious? I really don't know but if I wanted something healthy, I'll eat a salad. 2/5

Porchetta:
POR-KE-TA...not porch-eta...not porsche-eta. C'mon! I enjoy a good porchetta sandwich. That fat and oil with herbs, spices and salsa. My favorite version though has crispy skin and this one did not and tasted a bit much of fennel seeds. They are generous with pork portions though. 3.5/5

The hubs didn't care for it too much, but he would prefer a big-ass burrito wrapped in foil to something with complex flavors and interesting ingredients. :) I love him, but he's not a foodie. I really enjoyed it--the tacos were fresh, brightly flavorful, and the meat was perfectly cooked. The house wine was great, too. Didn't taste cheap, and at $9 a glass, it better not be! The kids' menu was totally do-able for my picky 6 year old. She had a quesadilla with fruit salad and gobbled it up. We told her no churro for dessert if she didn't...that did it! 

Dessert took 20-30 minutes to come out. Not sure what happened, but they noticed, and they comped the dessert, plus gave us a $10 voucher for next time--very classy move, and saved the experience.

4,AquaKnox,"I really wasn't expecting much from Aquaknox.  My mom and I ended up eating here only because Tao had a long wait, were were doing Bouchon the next night, and nothing else, besides the random food court junk, was open in the Venetian at 10pm.  

We shared the steak salad, the lobster bisque, and the pommes frites.  Everything was surprisingly incredible.  The bisque was probably the best I've had--not too creamy with bites of lobster that melt in your mouth.  The steak salad was delicious, and had more meat on it than I expected.  The dressing was perfect (though it's exact flavors escape me now).   The frites, while good, didn't come with any dipping sauce.  They weren't so spectacular that they could stand on their own so I would have liked a nice aioli or something.

They are made fresh every day and I think their hard work doesn't go unnoticed because they often sell out before closing every day. The outside eating area is also very nice!

2,St. Louis Bar & Grill,"This is was stop #4, right after Eton's, on the Danforth Social Meetup's 2nd Danforth pubcrawl.  What a contrast!

No live music, no friendly vibe, no patrons there just to have fun and are long since over themselves, no Walter to greet us and tell us about future dates. 

I felt like we needed to hit up at least one very ""chain"" place and that is exactly what this is.  Lots of screens, lots of sports, lots of the typical beer.

I felt like the staff were fine--saw no issue with the customer service.  A bouncer had to cut off one of our members but I never got the full story as to what was said to who.

The thing that did strike me was that it seems like there was a bad vibe here towards us.  It was mostly younger guys and groups of younger people but it felt like we crashed a party we were not invited to.  But this is a boring chain pub--aren't only the little independent dives allowed to act as club houses?

We didn't stick around for long.  Can't recommend it although it is totally fine for wings and safe beers if you need somewhere to go to watch the game.",2014-10-27,Toronto,-79.34725429999999,43.67841370000001,"['American (Traditional)', 'Nightlife', 'Restaurants', 'Sports Bars', 'Chicken Wings', 'Bars']"

3,Halcyon,"I am fairly snobby when it comes to restaurants.. But the front of the house and waiters looked really annoyed to be there. Who does that attract? Also, the waiter seemed kinda over it.. Maybe he was having a rough day. We asked him about the cheese selection and he told us it was ""like cheddar"" when it turned out like swiss instead. Just say you don't know rather than give me a lazy answer. 

Venue- Been here more than a few times, great decor and nice outdoor area as well. 

Food- The freshly baked bread is a great touch on their cheese plate and other sandwich type of dishes. The croissants were also delicious to start the meal. French toast was really nicely done and served with a berry syrup. Chicken sandwich was just ok, kinda bland. 

Drinks- Mimosa and wife's craft cocktail were also solid A-. 

So Halcyon,you have a great location, great local ingredients.. Now just learn to enchant your patrons. It is not the same feeling as Kindred, Barrington's, Rooster's, or Gallery where you leave feeling like the whole dinner service flowed seamlessly and that they want you back there again.

We had three appetizers: Thai Samosas, Chicken Stay and Tofu Paradise. Then my husband had the Seafood Pad Thai and I had the Chef's Specials: Prik Poa Talay. The food had a lot of flavor, fresh and crunchy veggies, spicy to your taste.
The restaurant is small, with only 24 seats. From the outside you wouldn't imagine the warmth of the dinning room; there are pillows on the seats up against the wall, candles lit on every table and a beautiful mural on the ceiling. 
Finally I have to agree with everyone that the Smiling Banana Leaf has great service, great food and no corkage fee. We'll definitely go back.",2012-11-07,Pittsburgh,-79.91956359999999,40.4758881,"['Restaurants', 'Thai', 'Taiwanese']"
5,Salad and Go,"This is pretty far outside my normal area, but I was in Chandler visiting a friend and he suggested we get drive-thru salads. ""Is that a thing?"" I asked, skeptical. In Tucson, it's hard to find a good salad anywhere. Apparently in Gilbert, they hand them out in the drive-thru.

I used Salad and Go's website to get information on several of their salads before we drove down there, and I was SHOCKED at the size of the salad for the price. Why don't we have these in Tucson?

My greek salad was fresh, fluffy, and had no shortage of feta cheese. When given the option, I asked for my dressing tossed in, and thought it was maybe just slightly too much, but not bad. I also added chicken to my salad (they also offer steak, shrimp, and some kind of imitation meat). The chicken was okay, not great; not bad enough to take a point off of the review.

As a single person who has trouble going through lettuce before it goes bad, I really wish there was something like this near my home or work. Salad and Go serves a better salad through their drive-thru than you can get in most restaurants, and at a better price.",2015-05-27,Gilbert,-111.807146887,33.3332755306,"['Food', 'Salad', 'Vegetarian', 'Juice Bars & Smoothies', 'Restaurants']"
3,Pink's Hot Dogs,I was pleasantly surprised to find a Pinks on the Strip. Being from SC I couldn't be on the West coast and not get one! So let's start with the cons  the shop is small and cramped thankfully it wasn't busy so we weren't bumping into people. The only seating was on a patio which was ok with the misting fans but those darn Pigeons . It made it very uncomfortable to enjoy my meal for fear of being pecked at my feet. So let's get to the pros location was right across the street from my hotel which had a pedestrian bridge. I ordered the Planet Hollywood(located at the Miracle Mile Shops at PH) it was a polish sausage with grilled onions/mushrooms nacho cheese and bacon got an order of fries as well. The dog itself wasn't salty like typical sausages which I appreciated but not much flavor. Although I liked the size considering the price it made it difficult to get all the toppings in every bite so they could have a party . The price came to $14 that was w/o a drink which is the cheapest thing I got out. I did notice on the menu they had a souvenir cup for $20 which was refillable for $10 which for LV I think is a great deal. The fries were good basic nothing special and the cashier was nice. I would try again bc like I said I'm from SC so I won't(actually can't lol) make my final judgement until I've had their chili dog.

4,Stingray Sushi,"Very nice atmosphere, especially now that it's cool enough for them to leave the tall windows open. The whole restaurant area feels open to the world. Very pleasant colors as well.

We came for happy hour and the menu didn't disappoint. Good selection of rolls and sushi and various non-sushi dishes for $3-$5. All we tried were good and tasted fresh. When ordering sushi on some special at other places, I sometimes wonder if they don't have a few baker's trays full of the stuff somewhere, leftover from a morning prep session. That wasn't the case here.

Drinks on special included Dos Equis for $4 and the house red or white for $3, as well as various cocktails. I wouldn't recommend the wine, actually: Bears distinct hints of ""3 Buck Chuck"". My companion had the Summer Sumo which was reported to be pretty satisfying. 

No complaints on the service. We were very well-attended over the course of over a 90 minute stay.

This is a good place to start the evening if you're doing a datenight at the Biltmore or Esplanade.",2012-10-24,Phoenix,-112.026206558,33.5105510376,"['Restaurants', 'Japanese', 'Sushi Bars']"

They have plenty of great beers on tap, daily specials, homemade desserts, and fantastic servers. Vegetarian and family friendly (to an extent) they likely will have something for everyone.

5,Kauai Cafe,"One look at my pictures will tell you I'm not from Hawaii. But I like the beach and I'd jump at the chance to get with a Hawaiian m--

Oh. TMI.

Point being, Hawaiian culture fascinates me, and even though I haven't been (yet) I find Hawaiians (and Pac Islanders) to be attractive not just in looks, but in personalities and in their cuisine!

Our foodventure last week took us to Kauai Cafe, which looked fairly unassuming from the front. Another hole-in-the-wall joint, one may say. But step inside, and you'll find what makes Kauai Cafe so ono.

I love chicken katsu, but it was a heavy battle between that and a platter called ""Da Surf Rider"" which basically is a Hawaiian fried seafood platter. I went with the less expensive of the options, the katsu, and thank goodness I did because the portions were HUGE! Emijandro's kalbi short ribs were practically falling off the plate as was my chicken. It was served with macaroni salad and the option between fried noodles, fried rice, or steamed sticky rice. I was trying to keep it healthy but since I had already spoiled that with chicken katsu, I went with the fried rice. Another great choice, as the fried rice has the usual accouterments, but also has bits of fried Spam (that ono Hawaiian treat!) mixed in. It was a fun and tasty addition to the usual fried rice one might find.

I thought the chicken was a little bit on the dry side, but the katsu sauce rectified that problem. Overall, a mighty fine meal.

So why the five star rating? I believe in Hawaiian slang you would say it's because of Da Kine Service.

The server (who may be an owner or related to an owner?) was super nice. He chatted with us for quite a bit, telling us about Kauai, which I found fascinating as Emijandro has been, but I never have. He talked about the experience of moving from Hawaii to Las Vegas, and the fact that like every other person that moves here, he never really suffered from allergies until hitting the 702.

The fifth star that sealed the deal came a week later, chatting with Emijandro in the car about the experience. Apparently behind where we sat (she could see it, I had my back to it), a homeless man was being shown island love: he was fed a warm meal, and they offered him one of their t-shirts to wear as the weather was starting to cool off and their t-shirt was heavier than the one he was wearing.

That, my braddahs and sistahs, is doing business right. Return trips are already being planned, even if it is way out past where the 215 wraps around the side of Vegas.

(OK, screw TMI -- any Hawaiian, Samoan, or Tongan men, I'm single and ready to mingle. We'll go to Kauai Cafe together... heh.)",2014-11-19,Las Vegas,-115.31320430000001,36.1002256,"['Hawaiian', 'Restaurants']"

When our drink glasses were empty, they were taken away and not once did anyone ask if any one of us wanted anything more to drink (very, very weird).

On my most recent visit I decided to go with the traditional hummus, stuffed grape leaves and dolmas. I liked the hummus but felt it could have been a bit for flavorful.

4,Timbers - Gibson,"I'm a fan!

This Timbers is located fairly close to my house - at Gibson and American Pacific, and they were recently listed in the RJ has a ""Chargers"" bar for this football season.  Since Beach House, our previous Chargers bar closed, I was looking forward to checking out a new place.

We were kind of forced in to going here for the 1st game of the season - just before game time, a HUGE storm hit, which knocked out our power and satellite. It did come back on, but I didn't want to risk this happening during the game, so we headed out to Timbers.

There are 2 different areas of this place - a restaurant side, with tables and booths - for all ages (and non smoking).  Then the glass enclosed bar side, where it's 21 and up only, and smoking is allowed.  This, of course, is where we sat.

They have plenty of TVs and a decent sound system.  The bartender was super friendly and provided great service.  We ordered drinks (they had beer and drink specials) and also food (also discounted).  I had the turkey burger sliders, which came with regular fries, and my Mom had the sweet potato fries.  Both were really good.  I was surprised at how good the turkey burger sliders were - and that they had a ton of toppings, including a slice of avocado.  Pretty good deal for $6.95.

It's rare that a buffet can keep the quality up on such a variety of things while serving items that pleasantly surprise. The Bacchanal Buffet absolutely failed in that respect.

2,Pin-Up Pizza,"BURNED

This end of the strip seems to be full of New York style pizza places selling slices. You know the type of pizza that Jon Stewart from ""The Daily Show"" thinks is the best pizza in the world. At the end of the day, real pizza comes from Italy and not any American city. I have never truly been a fan of NY style pizza. When I'm in NY I usually only buy a slice because it's cheap, fast and I'm hungry. 

So here I am in Las Vegas and not New York. I was really hungry and needed a bite to eat for my walk home down the street. I stopped in for a slice and they threw it in the oven. It was in the oven for rather a long time. I really wasn't in a hurry as I checked my emails and waited for it. 

I finally got my slice and I decided to bite into it. The problem was that the pizza temperature was set to nuclear radiation heat level. The piping hot cheese stuck to the roof of my mouth and I couldn't get it off in time. All I could think was why didn't the person handing me the pizza slice give me a warning like, ""Hey be careful because it's really hot!"" I didn't think it was hot because my slice looked dried out and there was no steam flowing out of it. A warning or something would have been a nice gesture. I also must take responsibility because I bit into it without thinking twice but I was hungry. 

I ended up with a nasty burn on the roof of my mouth. Luckily the roof of the mouth heals fast. I had to deal with the burn pain for a couple of days. It was annoying and made me have not fond memories of this place every time I ate something in Vegas. 

I really wouldn't recommend  this place unless you were hungry and just looking for a quick and cheap fix. Six bucks for a slice is not a bad deal in Vegas considering how expensive food is around here. I really wished I would have just walked by this location. The pizza wasn't that great just like New York City. If they were going for an authentic NY style pizza, then they nailed it. My only advice is to just check the temperature before biting in or you might get BURNED.

3,1947 Tavern,"Sometimes I just get a weird vibe from a place, and, while nothing was particularly unnerving, I got it from 1947 Tavern. We decided to try it at about 6:00 on a Friday, which, at many places, is kind of a jumpin' time with the leftover work crowd and early diners, like across the street at Harris. No so here. There were only two tables occupied by middle-aged couples, which was also kind of unusual. The place was attractive enough, but the empty bar and dining room gave me a bad feeling right away. 

The first drink I had was a bourbon/peach tea concoction, which was too bourbon-y for me, but my next drink, a frozen lemonade thing with Framboise, was tasty. 

As we drank and perused the menu, we noticed a few more middle-aged people and a really old dude come in alone with a newspaper. This guy seemed like he would be much happier scratching lottery tickets and complaining about ""kids these days"" at the end of the counter at Eat-N-Park. True to the stereotype, he asked a bajillion questions about the menu and made ridiculous demands for his meal. On top of this, there was an older, ""rough around the edges"" waitress...like, Tweety Bird sweatshirt, stretchpants, glitter eyeshadow, bad perm, mullet-rough. And I realize I'm being terribly critical of people who I'm sure are very nice, but people make or break atmosphere. All I kept thinking was how old and uncool the place felt because of all the old, uncool people. And last, but not least, the bartender was our waiter, who seemed to forget about us completely by the middle of service, and through an inquiry on our part, unofficially handed us over to another slightly less inattentive waiter. 

There was a bright spot to our visit, though...the food! We got the pulled pork appetizer thing, the kielbasa appetizer, and the bacon mac and cheese. Everything was really tasty. Now, I compare all mac and cheese to my favorite--my grandma's--which is a little drier and oniony. The Tavern's mac came close, though creamy. It was the best non-grandma mac and cheese I've ever had...and I've had a lot.

All told, we'll probably be back for the food and just hope that the clientele includes a few more ""youngsters"" like us.",2011-07-14,Pittsburgh,-79.93099959999999,40.455658899999996,"['American (New)', 'Nightlife', 'Bars', 'Restaurants', 'American (Traditional)']"
4,Mad Mex - Shadyside,"This place is hip and fun.

Definitely sit at the bar as your chips and salsa are free as opposed to sitting at a table where you have to pay for it. 

Also their bar staff have been there a while and know the menu and are very attentive to the customers.

However the host was unpleasant when we had asked for a seat near the bar to view the tv. The food runner told the dropped out food off and was too busy to answer the wifi password or to grab ketchup for the fries we had ordered.

4,Jerome Bettis' Grille 36,"It has an outstanding location between Heinz field and PNC Park. 

I thought this might be a tourist trap type of place.  But loved Jerome Bettis as a player and decided to go just the same.

The food was very good and the prices were not bad considering its location.  Let me just say this; don't eat here if you are not very hungry.  As one Steeler wrote on the wall, ""You can tell this is a big guy's place!""  That sums it up the portions are very large and most of the food is not very good for you.  I even saw a deep fried hamburger on the menu (not kidding).

We got the nachos for an appetizer and could have stopped right there.  It was the biggest nacho appetizer I have ever seen in a restaurant. My wife and I both got different salads which were wonderful but we could not finish because of the nachos.  The kids got cheeseburgers which they could not even eat half of.

The seats are comfortable and there are flat screen televisions everywhere you look.  We saw that several of the booth tables had their own TVs too.

The only negative was that there is no parking expect for the lot across the street and price to park there varies depending on the day and what is going on around that location.  Parking can vary from $5 to $25.",2013-07-31,Pittsburgh,-80.0113372,40.44555020000001,"['Bars', 'American (New)', 'Nightlife', 'Restaurants', 'Beer', 'Wine & Spirits', 'Sports Bars', 'American (Traditional)', 'Food']"

4,Ting Thai Caravan,"After a long journey from Birmingham to Edinburgh on Monday, a healthy and fulfilling lunch was in order. After checking into our hotel, our Edinburgh expert suggested that we head to Ting Thai Caravan for lunch. Now, I am a bit of a fan of Thai (but there isn't a huge amount of options for the cuisine in Birmingham), so I was excited at the prospect of having something a bit exotic to fill the belly and get me ready for a week of learning.

This place is relatively new in the Burgh, and as such, can get very busy. We were pretty lucky! Being a group of 6 (which then turned into 8), we were warned there might be a bit of a wait but ended up being seated within about 5 minutes.

The place has a lovely aesthetic. With hard wood and not too much going on decor wise, the main focus is definitely the food. I was pretty hungry, so was warned that if I ordered the soup I might want to opt for a small boxed meal to go with it. This was a great call as I got to try the spicy soup (I cannot remember for the life of me what it was called, but it had quite a few large king prawns in it) and the salad with peanuts and (surprise) more prawns. 

The salad was fantastic! Colourful, fresh and tasty. Just the right amount of spice to leave a tingle on the tongue, but not overpower the other flavours. The soup was the star of the show on this visit. Great broth, big prawns and lots of other ingredients (the portion size was just right). 

I opted to just have water with my meal, but they did a lovely coconut water with fresh pieces of coconut floating in it too. My two courses came in at around £11, which makes this a great place to grab a quick, healthy and tasty lunch if you're about in Edinburgh. I would definitely recommend this venue.",2014-07-11,Edinburgh,-3.1899895000000003,55.945634,"['Restaurants', 'Food', 'Thai']"
1,Roy's Restaurant,"7PM reservation on a Saturday night for four. Restaurant about 3/4 full. Seated on time. Ordered drinks and  appetizers which arrived fairly quickly. The appetizers were very good and we looked forward to our main courses. 

We waited almost an hour for our entrees. No explanation given. I had the Jade Pesto Mahi Mahi. Dry, tasteless. I had starting eating it and was trying to figure out why it had no flavor or moisture when I realized there was no pesto sauce, just a piece of grilled fish. No hint of basil, garlic, pine nuts or olive oil. Did they forget? Or is that their bizarre interpretation? Another member of our party had the Shellfish Sampler for which Roy's is famous. Equally flavorless. A third the Trio. Same. Roy's used to be known for its fish. Only the Surf and Turf that the fourth member of our party ordered had some flavor. I ordered a second, different glass of wine and was brought the same as the first.  At the next table a patron was complaining about her entree and insisted on a replacement. Maybe we should have done the same but we had already been there an hour and a half.

We finished appetizers and the main course and paid our bill by 9. Two hours for an unsatisfying meal with a bill of $250+ for four. We have eaten at this Roy's before and the one that used to be at Indian Bend and Scottsdale Road. Our memories were of much better meals of much better value than this.

I witnessed their interactions with a few people who came and went while we were there and was very pleased. They seems to have a great relationship with their regulars and it is no wonder people keep coming back!

They have a great special which includes 2 rolls and a soup or salad. We ordered 4 rolls, a soup, salad and 2 drinks and it came out to just around $20.

After browsing through the menu I decided on the farmhouse omelet with ranch dusted potatoes. The omelet was filled with well seasoned and tender vegetables but the scrambled egg was overcooked and thus a little tough. I loved the potatoes. They were lightly crisp, perfectly tender on the inside and the ranch ""dust"" gave the potatoes a whole new dimension of flavor. I also had some of the hummus nachos which had smooth creamy hummus with crisp, slightly chewy pita triangles. The balsamic vinegar drizzle on top was a great touch.

Service was friendly and warm. Our server was spot on with refilling coffee and water.

It was chilly and a little rainy outside and while there are heaters outside they still weren't powerful enough to keep me feeling comfortable sitting outside. By the time we were finished with our meals my feet felt frozen.

I searched Yelp for some food spots in the area. This establishment was literally 30 seconds from The Riddle Room and we haven't had any Thai since we've been here. Yelp advised that this was a ""hot and new"" location in Toronto so that sold us. Yelp did not steer us wrong. The decor is sleek, modern and very clean. Was only three other tables seated when we got there and it's a fairly spacious restaurant. It started filling up by the time we were leaving and now we know why. The server was insanely kind, personable and attentive. I ordered the red chicken curry (comes with pineapple but you can substitute with veggies which I did) and my fiancé got the Bangkok PadThai. The plating was beautiful (I didn't get the best picture because I was too eager), each dish had the perfect amount of spice. The curry had an awesome texture and exploded with flavor. Not to mention it came out within 10 minutes. I couldn't finish it all at the time, but as soon as I got back to the hotel and set the bag down, I just busted the container right open again.

I like this place because it reminded me of the bowling alley on times square. We all had a great time thanks to our hostess/server named Lauren she was always there to serve us. I believe the server can give you a great or shitty experience. But Lauren she gave us a awesome experience! She served our meals and drinks quickly through out the whole night, she kept our table clean and clear always brought new dishware. We had a group of 10 people so we had a overload of food all of us was pleased with her professionalism and quickness. We must have asked her to serve us at least 10 times she worked quickly stayed kind, cheerful and funny, brought laughs to all of us. I've had rude servers in the past but Lauren treated us great I'am glad she didn't get annoyed. She always stopped by to see if we needed anything she arranged for my cake to be stored in the fridge I was a bit worried because my boyfriend spent $350.00 on the cake she reassured us everything will be fine and so on. I'd have to say lucky strike has a great worker  I think she should be recognized as employee of the month and for being such a hard worker possibly give her a pay increase for such outstanding work ethics.

3,Earl of Sandwich,"Light fare in the ""mall food court"" of Caesar's Palace.  Earl of Sandwich serves medium sized sandwiches for the gambler who wants lunch but put too much money into the slot machines that day.  Bread is heated before sandwich assembly.  The sandwich preparation takes a similar amount of time as your typical Panera, not as fast as Jimmy John's.  In the Caesar's Palace location, my sandwich was a little over $10 after tax.

Highlights: You get a choice between white or wheat bread, which is heated as your sandwich is prepared and is soft.  Better than other fast food chain bread, not as satisfying as bread for a sandwich made from a bakery.  I ordered the Full Montagu, which is a sandwich with roast beef, turkey, Swiss, and cheddar.  The meats were of good quality.

Critiques: For $10, the sandwiches are small.  I'm accustomed to getting large subs that are longer, have twice as much meat, and filled with twice the vegetables at the supermarket.  These supermarket subs will usually cost less than $8.  While the bread at Earl of Sandwich is decent, I like the bread from my favorite supermarket better.  In short, I thought I got an okay, underwhelming small sandwich for the price I paid.

Overall: If you're too lazy to leave Caesar's Palace for lunch and want to buy a meal that's less than $15, then this may be an okay choice.  If you're looking for a high value cheap meal, I'd suggest getting food elsewhere.",2016-11-21,Las Vegas,-115.175836422,36.1177242049,"['Restaurants', 'Coffee & Tea', 'Food', 'Caterers', 'Sandwiches', 'Event Planning & Services', 'Food Court']"

5,The Griddle Café,"Best thing ever to come Vegas. Don't confuse this with other ""the griddle"" restaurants that have been around Vegas.  This is The Griddle that I would wait in a line outside on Melrose Ave in LA for 3 hours just to eat the delicious breakfast. This is open 24 hours!  I have been 3 times to this location already.  The busiest I've seen it is 10am.  There was a 30min wait. We easily snagged seats at the bar and avoided waiting.  

My first visit I requested my FAVORITE breakfast item using the ""secret password"".  The servers had no idea and I was absolutely bummed.  The owner I believe her name is Judy was an ABSOLUTE DOLL. She was so kind and accommodated my special request.  Cooked it for me herself!  So long as I promised to try the Mama's French Toast.  I can't get into detail about this secret password item. Not sure if I'm allowed to. (If you find out... It's amazing!) I tried the mamas French toast and I love it. Ordered it 2 more times after I think I am hooked.  Bread so thick.  The flavor is just perfect, addicting, and different from any French toast I've had.  I only use butter no syrup the way Judy suggested. WOW!  

Side of bacon. 4 pieces very thick honey tasting yummy. Cooked even. Neither soft nor crunchy. 

Extensive menu so many things I would try.  Full bar!  Spiked shakes.  Everything!  Portions are huge. Appears entrees don't all come with sides. After ordering sides the tab really adds up. French toast, bacon, one egg, and milk $20. 

The servers are pretty nice.  I did try one of the cocktails consisting of Hennessy and frangelico. Took one sip hated it. The server asked me what I thought however after I voiced my opinion did not offer to change it.  I ordered it so I don't mind paying for it.

The food on the other hand was over priced and nothing special. We asked the waiter what he recommended and he said the crispy skin dorade was the most popular item on the menu so we both ordered it. Overall I think the presentation was nice but it was missing something. Definitely not worth $32. We also started the meal with the 3 dips: roasted cauliflower hummus, baba ghanoush, and tzatziki. They were all fairly good but the tzatziki was by far the best. It had an excellent taste and it tasted very fresh.

Le tout pour 11,50$. Je montre les concombres au serveur et je lui dis que le burrito est beaucoup trop salé aussi et que le fromage n'est même pas fondu. Ça n'avait pas l'air de lui déranger de servir des concombres pourrie à la clientèle. Il me fait payer la note quand même...pas de problème. Lol Le décor est vraiment cheap et le service au table est pitoyable. Un serveur sans aucune expérience dans un restaurent espagnole ils ne savait même pas ce qu'il y avait dans les assiettes. Et le fêta  qu'il mette dans la salade n'a pas sa place, ce n'est pas un restaurant Grec. Il faut être créatif et créer une salade de style mexicaine ce n'est pas compliqué.

It was the week of Christmas and time for my annual dinner date with my dad.  I chose Rosewood because it was close to the highway and he could get there easily on his way home from work.  

To my great surprise the restaurant was lovely.  I found the aesthetic to be beautiful.  The service was spot on, attentive but not overly-so.  Our waiter did not give the usual annoyed vibe that we were there and had gifts to exchange and chatted a while prior to placing our order.  Our waiter also made good wine and entrée recommendations.

3,Packs & Dogs,"Too hungry to make it all the way home the other night, a drained, hungered, athirst Kay and Darren made their way to Mt. Washington for refreshment and comfort on a scalding, congested day. 

What we found was the illegitimate son of D's Sixpax and Dogs from Regent Square. Upon entering, our ears were assailed by stridently played-to-death selections from AC/DC and Motley Crue. The music was blaring so much that the gent taking our order at the red-and- silver, diner-style counter could hardly hear my words. I should have brought my earplugs. 

Like another reviewer, I too ordered the Golden Retriever, a Steeltown take on a Chi-Town classic complete with all the appropriate accessories (radioactive relish, dill pickles, tomatoes, celery salt, school bus-yellow mustard, and sport peppers). The frank itself was grilled immaculately, its natural casing snapping like bubble wrap with every breach of my incisors, its juicy beef essence permeating each chomp, the accompanying toppings only enhancing and never distracting from the proteins at hand. 

And the fries were ochroid spud cudgels par excellence with their coats of outer crispness and plush insides. 

The bacon cheeseburger might have been a winner had it been cooked to medium rare instead of well-done. Judging by the dense texture, I suspect it may have been in a freezer a bit too long as well. The bacon was very crisp, however, and the other fixings, including the bakery-quality bun (used for the dog also. did they both come from Grandview Bakery?), were plentiful and fresh.

Packs and Dogs has an odd mancave/greasy spoon/bro-bar vibe about it that I'm not sure works. As I alluded to before, the music was entirely too loud, especially considering that this was an early Thursday evening and that attendance was scant; it was as if a kegger party was being held and hardly anyone showed up. A MMA program could be seen on the flatscreen telly on the wall, but due to the noise (and I love loud, heavy music, just not when I'm trying to eat at a restaurant) we couldn't hear anything uttered by Joe Rogan or the muscled, deformed-of-ear fighters he was interviewing. Leather couches, a jukebox, and a dart board populate the front, which I suppose is intended to create a comfortable ambience, but I cannot imagine that being the case at P&D's on a sultry, intoxicated Saturday night. 

While quite obviously a copycat of the East End's version, Mt. Washington's Packs and Dogs misses the bullseye in terms of atmosphere despite making mighty fine hot dogs and french fries. You can relax at D's. Here? Not so much, I reckon. At P&D's busiest, you may have luck getting into a fight, finding a liason, drinking yourself into the gutter, or simply garnering attention to your tanned, scarcely-garbed self.  

P.S. Packs and Dogs would be an effortless 4 stars if it was just a hot dog stand and nothing more.",2012-06-30,Pittsburgh,-80.0070634,40.429931200000006,"['Restaurants', 'Nightlife', 'Hot Dogs', 'Bars']"

3,Red Velvet Cafe,"Disappointing...I was to the Red Velvet Cafe with my ladies dinner group.  It was a last minute decision since our original restaurant choice had closed.  However, I had heard raving reviews and it was supposed to offer healthy food and (gasp) vegan meals.  

I was disappointed to find out that the entrees offered were almost all meat-based or had cheese.  Red Velvet prides itself with being healthy?  For the Standard American DIner, offering baked chips instead of potatoes chips may cut it.  I eat plant-based for my health.  So for a healthy vegan, offering to swap out the meat with faux meat and dairy cheese with soy cheese is not healthy eating.  

I ended up with a panini sandwich, where I asked for the cheese to be swapped with avocado.  They were happy to accommodate the request without an extra charge.  I also tried the tiramisu.  By the all, all the desserts are vegan.  It was more of a cake than the traditional tiramisu style.  It had the right taste, but not the texture I was expecting.

I would return to Red Velvet for dessert and a cup of coffee, but I wouldn't return for a meal unless they offered more healthy plant-based entrees.

4,La 15 Y Salsas,"I have had one lunch here, but I was so impressed that I want to give a supporting review right away so that they stay in business.

It is in a nondescript strip mall in Sunnyslope.  I probably wouldn't have tried it except for some good reviews I read.  Inside, it is much nicer than I had expected, although more authentic, casual Mexican than anything upscale.

I went here specifically for the mole negro, one of my favorite dishes.  I got the one with three enchiladas, stuffed with chicken, smothered in mole. I believe it's called enmolado.   Very generous amount of mole, filling the plate, double the amount of mole I have ever gotten in any other restaurant.  It was delicious, filled with generous chicken, overflowing with mole negro sauce.  The owner/proprietor came out to see how I liked it and brought me a free serving of smooth guacamole.  Her son came out later with a free agua fresca drink made from some tropical fruit I don't know.  They just want to be friendly and to have you like their restaurant and food.  This is definitely a small, neighborhood,  mom & son-run authentic Mexican restaurant, specializing in Oaxacan cuisine, and I use the word ""cuisine"" deliberately.

Ordering at the counter is a bit challenging because there are a lot of dishes listed on the overhead board that you don't find in the usual Mexican restaurant, and the sweet woman who owns and runs the place has adequate but not too strong English.  The effort is well worth it, and they do have a printed menu available that you could just take to your table.

I was the only customer late in the day, so very quiet.  There was a tv on in the corner with a Spanish-language show, but so low that I wasn't really aware of it.

In addition to the very warm, friendly service and pleasant atmosphere, the menu lists a large number of Oaxacan dishes that are new to me.  This is not your typical Mexican restaurant; it is not your typical menu, although you will find some familiar items.  There is much to explore if your are a foodie, and based on my one experience, well worth it.  I would have the mole dishes every week, if I could.  I am returning there in two days for lunch and bringing two new converts to Oaxacan cuisine.  And I need to add that the prices are very reasonable.",2013-07-30,Phoenix,-112.09141329999999,33.571042600000006,"['Food', 'Specialty Food', 'Restaurants', 'Ethnic Food', 'Imported Food', 'Mexican']"

1,Apple Spice Junction,"Man oh man... I can't decide whether I want to review this place or not under the auspices of ""if you don't have anything nice to say...""

All I have to say is this: 

We ordered food. It came totally wrong. I asked for a vegan salad, not specifically, but that's how I ordered it, and it came with chicken and cheese. This just shows a complete inability to read the order. People make adjustments all the time. I have worked at a restaurant. I have fucked up. I should have been lashed 40 times! Read what people order! 

So when I got the wrong salad and saw what an unbelievable disappointment it was going to be, I ordered a veggie sandwich instead, which, to their credit, they delivered and took off the bill. 

The best customer service in the world could not overcome this sandwich. It was a monumental fucking embarrassment. I cannot believe they let that thing out the door. I ate it because I was starving but I would have liked to have driven it back there and go through it, ingredient by ingredient, with the preparer... Explain to me how this is appealing to the eyes, mouth, stomach, etc.

I just hated it. A lot.

The reason for only 3 stars is the atmosphere. It is a great warehouse for a quick lunch, but not an enjoyable dinner. The room is sooo loud you have to scream at the person making your pizza. All you hear of the background music is the base, because that is all that breaks thru. And, in creating a positive customer attitude, the greeter was smiles and bubbly and happy.

3,Pittsburgh International Airport,"Pittsburgh International airport is what I call a ""ghost town"" airport as compared to other major cities. It consists of a landside and airside terminal which is connected by two air trains.

They have Wi Fi but unfortunately it is of poor quality and I end up having to use my data plan. They do have a number of charging stations. Most of the shoppes are on the airside terminal which unfortunately you have to pass through security to get to.

When I fly, I normally take early flights and arrive sometimes to find that the carrier's station hasn't even opened yet. However, on the plus side I find I normally don't have a problem flying out of the airport on time.

Another perk is parking in that if use have a turnpike E-Z pass then you can use it to park in one of their 3 lots. There is no discount on parking but it saves you the trouble of having to get a ticket and pay it.

They do have a cell phone lot for arrivals but limited to an hour. On the air side terminal there is some renovation going on but they do have some grab and go food and some stores. I normally don't have time for these stores because I need to get to a gate.

At one time the airmall was a very nice place to visit but now since it is limited to passengers only I think it has gone downhill. There are nice shops there but I usually prefer to spend my money at my destination.

Still for being a small airport it has advantages of not overly long lines to get through security and if you check baggage then it doesn't take a whole lot of time to retrieve it. The airport is easy to get around so it has some things going for it.",2014-10-13,Pittsburgh,-80.2560925484,40.4958772052,"['Restaurants', 'Fast Food', 'Airports', 'Hotels & Travel']"

It's nice to find a sushi place open all day...a rarity in Charlotte. The only complaint is small in context. Sushi lunch prices, including hot saki, were reasonable and competitive. The only exception was a tasty but overpriced avocado roll, at $5.00. They usually go for $3-3.50 locally.

Jay ate noodles with chicken and he loved them.   We had to trick him into coming to a Vietnamese restaurant because he has had bad experiences in the past.   However, not this time.

Michele had spicy vermicelli noodles with beef and she loved them.    Jasmine tea was very good.   If I had to criticize, there was one flaw -  the stems on the mountain chillies were not removed.   I had to pick them out and break off the stems.

We came here on a Saturday night after a show, and even at 9:30 PM, our reservation saved us a pretty long wait. Started with the tiger shrimp and had the lamb porterhouse chops for the main event.

4,C-Fu Gourmet,"We just visited C-Fu Gourment this past weekend. We have tried other Chinese places and loved them, but was looking to try a new one. We decided on this location. My husband was skeptical at first (he wanted to try another one) but he finally agreed. I am so glad we went. We had our 4 year old with us and it wasn't very crowded. She loves Chinese food and trying to use chopsticks. One thing we noticed is that the menu did state MSG is used but speak to your server about other options. The other options was basically the server writing down no MSG. They are able to prepare any of the dishes without it. When our food came, the server also brought my daughter chopsticks without being asked. She loved that. She also loved the food and as promised, it contained no MSG (I get sick after eating MSG). The food was not very greasy. My husband had ordered a beef and bell pepper dish but didn't eat all the bell peppers. This is because he personally loves the flavor peppers brings, but doesn't like to eat alot of the actual peppers. The manager/owner came over and let us know they could customize any dish and he could just ask for no peppers next time. When my husband explained he likes the flavor, she smiled and went ah ok. I loved that the manager/owner had come over just to make sure everything was alright. The best thing is that this Chinese place caused no reaction. Sometimes when I eat Chinese food, I make a few trips to the bathroom  (even in places that state no MSG) but this was not the case. I didn't even need to go in once and neither did my husband.

2,Ding Tai Fung,"Let's just get this out of the way, if you are looking for the REAL Din Tai Fung, this is NOT the same thing.  This is a knock off called Din(g) Tai Fung.  It's one thing to try to replicate another restaurant's success, but to try to trick customers with the same name is just wrong.  Unless there is some story behind this, they blatantly tried stealing the name of the original Din Tai Fung and I'm guessing because their name is off by one character they can somehow get away with it.

We were visiting Toronto for the first time.  I purposely drove an extra 30 minutes from Toronto in hopes of having the classic DTF experience.  When I drove up to the restaurant, I knew something seemed fishy.  If you've ever been to any real DTF, the overall appearance is definitely off.  If I hadn't already drove 30 minutes out of my way to come here, I probably would have left, but I decided to give them a chance.  Sure they have the guys at the window making the XLBs, but that's about it.  I tried convincing myself, maybe this was one of the original locations, so they went for a more old-fashioned/authentic look and less like the other more commercialized locations in the US.  But once the food started coming out, it was obvious.  Everything was similar, but yet everything was slightly off plus with a lower quality.  IMO, the only thing that keeps this place alive is their XLBs are decent.  If I had to rate the XLBs by themselves, I would say maybe 3.5/5 stars.  They weren't great, but good.  The skin wasn't too thick, which I like, but not DTF thin.  However the rest of the food was just like any average restaurant, some were OK and others weren't that great.

If this place had some other generic Chinese Restaurant name, I probably would have given them 3/5 stars.  If I lived in the area and had an XLB craving, I would probably come back.  It would be an okay local place to eat.  However since they purposely chose to try trick customers into believing this is a real DTF, I have to lower their rating for that.  As a visitor, I could have gone to so many other good Chinese restaurants, but because of their name they got me.  So congratulations, at the end of the day you win because you got my money.  Shame on me for not digging a little deeper.  Sigh... hopefully others who read my review will at least know it's FAKE and can make their own decisions on whether they simply want some decent XLBs.",2015-10-11,Markham,-79.34862700000001,43.848501,"['Restaurants', 'Dim Sum', 'Ethnic Food', 'Food', 'Chinese', 'Specialty Food']"

5,Daisy Cafe & Cupcakery,"Two friends and I just ate lunch at Daisy Cafe and Cupcakery on its fourth day in business (today is May 21, 2009), and we were very pleased.  The service was slow (hopefully just a first-week-open problem that they'll solve soon), but the staff was very friendly and the food was delicious.

I ordered the fresh vegetable strata, a souffle-ish dish of eggs, cheese, veggies, and bread cubes.  It was wonderful!  The eggs were light and fluffy, the bread cubes were a nice crusty contrast, and there was just the right amount of gruyere cheese baked into the dish to make it flavorful without being overwhelming.  It came with a side of seasoned roasted red potatoes and fresh fruit, all of which was excellent.  My friend, Michael, ordered the beef and bacon meat loaf, which came in its own adorable little dish and was perfectly cooked, moist and flavorful with lots of yummy little vegetable chunks mixed in with the ground meat.  My other friend, Haley, ordered the egg sandwich, which we all agreed was a serious egg sandwich, in the best sense.  No mere fried egg slapped on a roll with some cheese, this was, rather, a well-considered sandwich of crusty bread, egg, gruyere cheese, and red onions (which added an especially flavorful kick).

Full but not wanting to pass up the bakery section of Daisy, we each got a cupcake to go.  While the presentation was lovely, it seemed rather wasteful to put each individual cupcake in its own cardboard box (with an additional stabilizing cardboard device inside).  Once I ate the cupcake, however, I realized why such accoutrements were necessary: the frosting on the cake was so soft that it was even a bit melty, and the cake itself was rather spongey and soft.  I prefer a firmer cake with a thicker, stiffer frosting, so this did not particularly suit my fancy (I did, however, appreciate the taste of the frosting, which was whipped cream, as opposed to the more typical buttercream frosting--this was much less sweet, and the fruit flavoring was quite obviously real).

So go for the meal, skip the cupcake, and enjoy the open, sunny room, the good tunes on the stereo, and the friendly vibe while you wait (hopefully not too long) for your server to take your order!",2009-05-21,Madison,-89.3426022,43.093672399999996,"['American (New)', 'Restaurants', 'Food', 'Bakeries', 'Breakfast & Brunch']"

Order the Schezuan noodles, i believe it was the first one under the noodle soup section.  Yes it is $14.00 but don't bitch, its by far the best noodle soup dish, dark broth think oily star anise, tender chunks of beef, some not so much as the others. My friends ordered other noodle soups and mine was by far the best, with the most complex savory tasting broth, scoop in lots of hot sauce, bomb! I just wish the broth was hotter and the meat was more tender, but beggers can't be choosy.

It was a short walk from the museum, located on the mezzanine level of the California hotel/casino. 

The menu is pretty simple, and the meals are about $10 each, they can easily be shared or saved for a second meal later in the day! They come with rice and macaroni salad. I'd say, if you're in the downtown area and enjoy Hawaiian food, this is your place!",2016-04-24,Las Vegas,-115.14474209999999,36.1729495,"['Hawaiian', 'Japanese', 'Asian Fusion', 'Filipino', 'Restaurants']"
5,Fleming's Prime Steakhouse & Wine Bar,"I have been to the Summerlin location multiple times and decided to try out the one in Town Square due to moving across town. I've been a huge fan ever since the first time I visited a Fleming's. 

As soon as I walked in, I was greeted by upbeat and helpful employees that quickly helped me find my friend whom I was meeting there. After taking a seat, I did not have to wait long at all before another well put together and positive attitude employee (Jessica Saitta) had myself and my drink order taken care of. 

Jessica continued to help us throughout the night and provided what was BY FAR the best experience I've had at any Fleming's as well as the majority of any other dining experiences I've had. She was very attentive and truly a genuine person. She always was able to carry a fun conversation every time she checked in with us. I instantly felt like a friend rather than just another customer.

I've returned to Fleming's many times for the good food, drink selections and general atmosphere/decor BUT Jessica is the reason I will only be returning to the Town Square location from now on. I have an unlimited amount of positive things to say about this restaurant and their staff. I highly recommended it to anyone.",2014-05-13,Las Vegas,-115.173747385,36.0695675256,"['Bars', 'Steakhouses', 'Restaurants', 'Wine Bars', 'Nightlife', 'American (New)']"
3,KOOYI Korean Grill,"We came in on a rainy day - ordered fried chicken and the chicken bowl with Kim chi. It wasn't flavorful.

The fried chicken was basically popcorn chicken (not wings) topped with creme sauce and their sauce. Wasn't crunchy - was ok.

The chicken bowl was disappointing. Didn't have a distinct taste, which is surprising because it has kimchi. Quite underwhelming.

So if you're into heavy, fried ""Korean"" food - then it might be ok.",2016-09-17,Toronto,-79.4015556,43.654171399999996,"['Barbeque', 'Restaurants', 'Tapas/Small Plates', 'Korean']"

3,Naked Fish's Sushi & Grill,"Not sure if this is a fair review since I didn't really eat a full meal.  We did take-out for a light midnight snack.  I order the sashimi dinner.  You have the option of ordering 7 or 14 pieces of sashimi (it's $25 for the 14 pieces).  I thought the price was fair.  It came with miso soup and rice.  I thought the fish was pretty fresh, for Vegas at least.  I rather have this than AYCE here in Vegas.

My boyfriend ordered just philly rolls, and he really like them.  He compared it to the philly rolls from an AYCE place we went to the following day, and prefers this one a lot more.  It's smaller in size, which I think sushi should be (bite size) and much fresher in quality.

I've been to this place before when it first opened, but I don't really remember much of it.  Hope to give it another try later on.",2010-12-29,Las Vegas,-115.27971699999999,36.119242799999995,"['Japanese', 'Restaurants', 'Sushi Bars']"

There was only one man doing the cooking and the other was just hanging out the whole time.

2,Jumbo Super Buffet,"Well, the good news is, I didn't get sick from the food, and neither did any of my colleagues.  

The bad news is, it's just not remarkable in any way.  Sure, the $5.55 price tag is pretty entertaining and economical, and even with a drink, you're getting out of this place for under $10.   But our meal offerings just weren't memorable.  It just didn't sit right with me, you know?  I felt compelled to be careful what I ordered, and my Jedi instincts served me well.  But it just wasn't ""Oh my God"" amazing, nor did it compel me to go for seconds, or thirds.  I took the ""Indiana Jones"" approach and ""chose wisely"" for food selections, so I was fine.

Service was decent.  Nothing out of the way in terms of what we got, but it was acceptable enough to serve its needs.

3,Ogden's Hops and Harvest,"Came in for their new weekend brunch menu for my fiance's birthday but there were only 4 breakfast offerings so we ordered off of the lunch menu. 

Mains:
BLT - asked for the basil aioli on the side, which was the only sauce listed on the menu. It did come on the side but the lettuce was drizzled with something that looked like russian dressing, so we sent it back to get it dry as ordered. The bread was good but not a lot of bacon and the tomato overpowered everything so we wouldn't order it again. 

Starters:
Blue Corn Cakes (complimentary) - delicious and super moist.

Crispy Chicken Sliders - this was good but again asked for the buttermilk ranch on the side which was the only sauce listed in the menu but the arugula was dressed with some sort of vinaigrette. The waitress said there was nothing on it, but after we pointed it out to her she said she didn't know. We ate it anyway and might order it again.

Grilled Cheese Bites - the best thing we ordered! It was simple but tasted so good. Would definitely order again. It might be the only reason we come back to try their happy hour.

Spicy BBQ Pork Belly - the waitress described it as crispy and not very spicy, however it was the exact opposite. Really fatty pieces of pork belly soft with hardly any meat and extremely spicy. No one at the table would eat it so we sent it back.

Sides:
Mac & Cheese - not very cheesy. It wasn't bad but it wasn't good either. Wouldn't order again.

Dressings/Sauces:
Buttermilk ranch - pretty good, but an average house made dressing.

Bacon mustard - amazing! I would order something just to put that on it. 

Beer cheese - did not taste that much like beer or cheese.

Basil aioli - really good with lots of basil flavor.

Drinks:
Watermelon Cream - absolutely disgusting, it tasted like dirt. No one would drink it so we sent it back. People at other tables who ordered it didn't drink it either. It probably wasn't a good sign that when watching them make it they had to dump it out the first time and re-do it. My guess is no one on staff knew how to make it. 

The waitress didn't quite know how to handle a lot of the screw ups that were going on and also didn't seem to know the menu. The manager did come over and apologize and they didn't charge us for anything we sent back.

I had the duck curry with jelly fish appetizer. I've never tried jelly fish before but it was amazing, and the duck curry was just as good - the prices might seem a little up there but you definitely get what you pay for - not to mention the portions are of good size.

However, my husband and I sandwhichs were inedible. The meat was so tuff you could not bite through it, I ended up just throwing mine away.

3,O.H.S.O. Eatery + NanoBrewery,"The Good - I love the dog friendly, great people watching, super beer selection, fun vibe, back patio. I've eaten lunch, come for the Sunday brunch, and enjoyed their happy hour. Good beer, fabulous patio, and good happy hour. Love the dogs. Tried the Strawberry Blonde Ale - very cool!  I would love to LOVE this place, however . . .

The Average - The food is nothing special. There is nothing bad about it but I would never come twice to eat their food. There is so much better bar food in Phoenix that they should do better. The brunch is Average plus. 

The Bad - I've never been a fan of their service. The inmates seem to be running the place. We seem to be props in their lives.  A mere inconvenience. 

The Ugly - We took half a hamburger home and found a hair in the burger. That'll turn you off of a place for good. I don't remember that ever happening to us before. Ever.  

Conclusion - I'd love to add this fun place to our regular rotation. The vibe is great. I'd love to bring our outoftowners. However, they have to get serious about the quality of the food and service.  I don't believe they think they're a restaurant. Maybe they think they're in the ""aren't we cool"" business.  Maybe they're right.

Chili pepper sauce was put in my delivery but not the powder pepper spice which was needed to add to my dishes since they did not add my spice. I will still order again for delivery because food is good, but will try to make it a point to spice up my food please.  I like it spicy hot.

1,Center Cut Steakhouse,"Please, don't waste your time or your money. If you're looking for a nice steakhouse experience, you'll need to go elsewhere.

 My friend came out from Michigan to celebrate my birthday with me. There are so many dining choices in Vegas, but we both wanted steak. Ruth's Chris at Harrah's sounded great,but they didn't have any reservations available (Sat. night).We were staying at The Flamingo (home to the Center Cut Steakhouse) and they happened to have tables available. I now understand why.

My friend and I are very easygoing people, and not demanding customers at all. This does not mean that we should be forgotten, and given sub-par service, which is what we received.There's really only two things a restaurant has to do to give a good dining experience.

1) SERVE ME !  Be attentive and courteous. If I didn't want to be served, I'd save myself the cost of gratuities, and eat someplace where I order up at the counter.

2) Serve me food that is as good, or better than I can cook myself.

The menu at Center Cut  is a la carte. We both started with the lobster bisque ($12). It took a while to arrive at our table. The flavor tasted more of tomato bisque than of lobster. We were half finished with it before our server checked back on us. I asked if we would be getting any bread or rolls, and she said it's on the way. These didn't arrive at the table until we were finished with our soup. This is sad....those rolls that took so long to serve...completely flavorless, as in, like...the worst we'd both ever had. I've always said ""You can easily judge a restaurant by the bread that they serve.""

When our entree's finally arrived....more disappointment.. I had the prime rib med-rare ($38). The price is for the meat only. I did not order any sides (which I think were about $9 ea,). My friend ordered the filet mignon (mediuium). My friend's meat did come with a puff of yorkshire pudding, which she said was flavorless. One positive note.....our meats were cooked to the wellness that we'd ordered.

My friend's filet was over-salted. She had to actually ask for steak sauce to make it palatable. We didn't have time to send anything back, as we had show tickets at another casino and couldn't afford to wait. My prime rib was O.K., but definitely not worth the cost.  For what I paid for the meat alone, we could have gotten two COMPLETE prime rib dinners elsewhere , just as good, with better service.

Like i said...There's too many choices in Vegas, and even if there wasn't, you won't find me here again.",2014-10-25,Las Vegas,-115.17215976799999,36.116436835100004,"['Steakhouses', 'Restaurants']"

3,Home Plate Grill & Bar,"Came here with a friend to order some breakfast- kind of weird because I didn't think that there was a bar/restaurant that would be open 24/7. 
When I walked in there were arcade games to my right- which I thought was kind of nice. Being able to bring the kids while having something to eat or a drink or two at the bar. 
When we sat down it took the waitress a while to give us the menu and serve us our drinks since she was the only server there. 
We ordered our food but ended up waiting for at least a half hour- not too bad since she was the only waitress. 

I ordered the Souvlaki breakfast while my friend ordered the three egg breakfast. 
I'm not sure if it was the cook or the food that I ordered but the chicken was not appetizing at all and had so much seasoning that I couldn't even taste the chicken. I ended up substituting the chicken for a ham steak (which came out pretty quickly). All in all the waitress was nice and the people were friendly. The food was okay but I wouldn't mind giving this place another try.

4,Le Sélect Bistro,"I'm not a huge fan of French food in general. I can't exactly pinpoint what it is, but I just never get excited about it. With that in mind, I was actually pleasantly surprised with my meal at Le Select Bistro.

Staff: Staff was friendly and accommodating. It was a large party and some were arriving later than others. They were pretty attentive throughout the night keeping our glasses full and ensuring we had everything we wanted. The food came at a fairly reasonable rate. It was a birthday so we had brought a cake. There was a plating fee which was unfortunate but no unheard of but they did add fruit to the plates so it wasn't just a fee for slicing a cake.

Ambience: Very comfortable for parties of all sizes. Great seating and tall ceilings. We made it pretty loud since we were such a large party. The soft light made it very intimate but it wasn't too dark which was great. I did find that our table was a little cramped but they cleared the table away pretty often so it wasn't too bad.

Food: I ordered Assiette de Charcuterie which was their assorted meats to start. It was alright and nothing unique about it. For my main I ordered the Poulet Grillé Bio which was their chicken on top of grilled vegetables. The chicken was a little overcooked but the zucchini and tomatoes was nice.

I think at the end of the day, the ambience and service made this a very nice experience. However, the food was good but nothing really wowed me.",2016-03-15,Toronto,-79.3968091867,43.6437840329,"['Restaurants', 'French', 'Breakfast & Brunch', 'Coffee & Tea', 'Food']"
2,Lee's Sandwiches,"Not impressed, in fact I'm rather disappointed.  I really like Vietnamese style sandwiches.  The fresh crusty bread, the varieties of meats and crisp veggies, the pâté--all blend together for an amazingly flavorful combo.  This was lackluster at best.  The bread was only semi fresh, and they didn't put pâté on it.  No pate?! Seriously? Guess what they substituted for the crowning glory of every bahn mi I've ever eaten? MAYONNAISE.  That's right.  They splooged mayo all over the thing, like it was squishing out the other end as I ate.  Ew! I HATE mayonnaise.  Freaking hell.  The meats and veggies were pretty good, but quite skimpy.  The price would have been very reasonable for a decent sandwich, but not for what they served me.  And I really hate to say that, because the folks behind the counter were very nice.  Service was friendly and efficient.  The place was clean.  But the food, the thing I came here for, was lacking.  So its two stars.  In future, I think I'll be going elsewhere.",2016-04-12,Chandler,-111.8748273,33.334598,"['Sandwiches', 'Coffee & Tea', 'Vietnamese', 'Restaurants', 'Ice Cream & Frozen Yogurt', 'Food', 'Asian Fusion']"
4,Bouillon Bilk,"The Montreal food scene is well talked about, with the added advantage of it being one of Anthony Bourdain's favourite places to visit because of its decadent food culture. My trip to Montreal, was a little less Bourdain-ish if you will- given that my trip was not consumed by the quest for a dish of foie gras, stuffed inside a red, bleeding hunk of meat, topped with another type of foie gras (you get the drift..). I was looking, however, to go for one very good meal, as a belated birthday dinner for my companion and boyfriend, Ben! After  much deliberation, I settled on Bouillon Bilk. I made a reservation a couple of weeks in advance, just to be safe. 

The atmosphere at Bouillon is somewhere in between casual and fine dining. It certainly doesn't give off the 25$ per person brunch restaurant vibe and  it certainly isn't the kind of place you'd never to think to go if you didn't have a jacket on. It makes for easy digestion, which can sometimes (in the very snotty restaurants) be hampered by the constant feeling of being stared at by your faithful server. Do not mistake this for sloppiness- the waiters are well dressed, attentive and well spoken (even if ours was rather stern at the start, she softened up later). 

Now for the food. My starter involved very soft, fresh crab meat, that was given character with the addition of sweet peas and an interesting almond crumble. Together, the three made for a good flavor combination on the palette- slightly bland but very good. Ben's starter was particularly unusual and excellent: linguini with uni (sea urchin). The portion was just right, not too much, but enough to fill a few fork-twirls with linguini, which was lathered with a sauce that had hints of fennel (pollen), citrus and chilli. Competing for 1st place with the sauce were the 4 pieces of uni on the top, succulent and sweet. Moving on to the main course, Ben's dish was scallops with Shitake mushroom, pea leaves and courgette done 2, perhaps 3 ways and also pear. The scallops were fresh, and the tender texture of the scallops and the Shitake mushrooms was balanced with the sweetness of the pear and the courgette. A very satisfactory and rather filling entrée. Mine was a ricotta ravioli with rabbit- the ravioli was topped with tender, tiny slivers of rabbit meat, morel mushrooms and a smattering of spiral green vegetables (that reminded me of the stickiness of okra but had a nice crunch to them). All of this in a light sauce and topped with crushed pistachios. Very good. And finally, dessert. I must mention that I almost never choose anything with chocolate for dessert, but I did this time and I wasn't sorry. We shared a chocolate Crème Prise with ricotta icecream. Three dollops of delightfully rich chocolatey goodness- a texture somewhere between mousse and ganache. This was accompanied by ricotta icecream and topped with cherries, cashews, coffee cream and a rich and bold coffee crumble. The cherries and the coffee had strong flavours which cut through the richness of the chocolate, while the icecream gave relief between each bite of chocolate, cleansing the palette for the next. 

We finished with tea (we also did have a glass of wine each, one of which was sub-par, but that can be easily forgiven and might also just be a matter of personal taste). The meal was, all things considered, excellent. I'd go back when next in Montreal and I highly recommend it.",2015-07-27,Montréal,-73.56588609999999,45.511072,"['Restaurants', 'Canadian (New)', 'Modern European']"

1,The Pink Grapefruit,"I had high hopes for this cute little spot in an area that could use more little coffee shops and healthy food options but it did not deliver. While the food I had was not awful (the quinoa salad had nice flavour though the dip I bought was only so so), there were other issues such as not delivering what a coffee shop / cafe should deliver in the downtown core, especially as it will attract a clientele that is green-minded, health conscious and in some cases (students), not able to dish out lots of money.

I went in and wasn't sure if I was going to order and the only reason I did is that there was nothing else comparable open nearby. My first issue was that they don't have plates or cups to be green for those who are staying. So my salad and other items - including glass of water, were in disposable plastic containers. I should have said no and went again my better judgment. I wanted to get an item that would require being heated up but they only had plastic containers to do so... even if it states on the container that it is microwaveable, does not make it safe, so that was a deal breaker for me.

The way the person who worked there handled a homeless person who came in (granted they were pan handling so I know it had to be handled) left something to be desired and when I asked for change (to leave a tip), I was told no because they had no change. 

Without wifi or tunes that give you a cafe vibe, this just has the purchase and go home feel that is not very competitive downtown. 

Since the food was not bad, and the prices, while not great (not for a student's budget) were not atrocious, if everything else aligns, then you're building great business. But it takes more than decent food to build a reputation.",2013-07-08,Toronto,-79.37356070000001,43.653648700000005,"['Coffee & Tea', 'Gluten-Free', 'Salad', 'Food', 'Restaurants']"

The decor is absolutely gorgeous and totally different from any other restaurant in Charlotte - a lot of money and attention was put into this place! All the different light fixtures were really eye catching and of course the ceiling with the whole book of The Art Of War on it- was really a nice touch!! 

Onto the most important part for me- the food! We first started with the below and had coursed it out so it wasn't all at once:

Grilled Flat Bread w shrimp- Perfect, light and had great flavors!
Bibb Lettuce- Nice and light 
Mushroom Gnocchi- My Favorite of the night!! Cooked perfectly!!
Crispy Szechuan Pork Belly- Crispy and delicious had a nice little crispy cabbage salad that it was served over
St. Louis Style Toasted Mushrooms- were good!! 
Indian Spiced Potato Pierogies- they had English Peas and Emulsion with them and they were really Tasty!! 

For my Entree I had the Tokyo Noodle Soup- which had Crispy Pork, a Poached Egg and Veggies in a nice Smoky Broth- Delicious!! I honestly don't remember what the other two had, I was more focused on my food!! 

Our Server was really nice and explained everything to us! The only bad thing I could say is that the music was a little too loud for dinner service they should hold off on putting it that loud until like 9 or later - I know i sound like an old lady but we found it difficult to hear the server or even runners when they dropped the food off- ok that's all I can think of this time I will be back soon!!",2012-05-29,Charlotte,-80.84277890000001,35.22836220000001,"['American (New)', 'Restaurants', 'Food', 'Breakfast & Brunch', 'Desserts']"

But then I discovered this little diamond in the rough!

Definitely Sushi Ken's greatest facet is its extensive menu. It has delivered almost everything I've craved that's hard to find here - cold and hot udon, soba noodles, katsu curry, ramen, karage, donburi, sushi and my favorite, Okinawan beer! Granted I would say it's definitely not the best of anything I've ever had (or anything close to it at all), but it does its job at fulfilling my cravings and at a very good price. Sushi is decent and rolls are excellent, especially their $5 roll deals! So far the only thing I've had that I have not liked at all which was the tsukemen which appeared to be just rice noodles in a very light soy based, simple broth. 

Overall, it is an excellent local, neighborhood restaurant and very nice staff that allows me to savor my once upon a time in Tokyo life again. Just a little bit.",2016-06-27,Phoenix,-111.99223799999999,33.305739,"['Sushi Bars', 'Restaurants']"

We ventured out to the patio for a beautiful Sunday afternoon. They were not too packed, and we were seated right away. After deciding on beers for the fellas, and a half priced bottle of wine for the ladies, we all agreed that it was gonna be difficult to choose an entree from their menu as everything sounded awesome. 

I ended up with the achiote salmon and chorizo arepa. WOW. asparagus, sweet corn cake with a hint of chorizo, and a wonderfully prepared piece of fish. This plate was UNREAL. Every bite was amazing. The salmon was cooked perfectly, and mixed with the asparagus, sweet corn cake, pablano chile sauce, it was the perfect bite every time. 

If you haven't figured it out already, I was flabbergasted. The deconstructed fish taco as well as the smoked pork tenderloin salad received similarly favorable reviews from my dining partners.

The lobster in the bisque was seasoned perfectly. 
The tomato blue cheese on crostini was smart and tasty. 
The Broth for the bisque was more soup adjacent than bisque creamy. 

The frites fried in duck fat came out hard with no condiment BUT BUT they were eager to figure something out and Asst. Server Shai did a great job of pulling together an aoili with a hint of spice and touch of sweet. 

The Oyster Rockefeller is served with cooked warm spinach, good amount of bacon and (not enough bread crumbs for me) BUT the Oysters are cold water - East Coast and they were huge. Done well and impressed the kid. Essentially, they passed the kid test so we'll swing around for those. 

Things to come: 
1) Happy Hour offering
2) I'm sure all the food will be heavenly next month when I return after the kinks are straight. 
3) I hope more butter fusion offerings. If not then Capitol Chophouse butter reigns. 

Things to expect: 
1) Good Service - These guys are only new to Rare. They are experienced and know their roles. They know pacing and appropriate amounts of conversation. 
2) An extensive wine list and their distributors include Frank Liquor; The beverage manager lived in NOLA for 10 years and carried away the accent. 
3) Mark & Clayton are two servers that I can vouch for. *Head Servers
4) Servers have business cards
5) Chicago steakhouse old feel but all spanky new
6) Multiple SubZero wine chillers maybe even a walk in humidor (or it's just another chiller). Either way - the place works
7) Salads made tableside by your server
8) Bananas Foster made tableside

To start it off, the coffee was really good (Black Jack! Espresso + black coffee). I got the mac n' cheese per everyone's recs on Yelp, which was absolutely mind blowing... ESPECIALLY when dipped in their homemade apple sauce. Husband got the omelette with mushroom and spinach... and that simple dish was just.... divine.

What makes Lucky's Cafe really special is the fact that they get the ingredients straight from their garden outside (you can actually see them go out and pick stuff), and they use them to cook your dish FRESH upon your order.

The omelette was especially amazing because of these fresh organic ingredients. The veggies were just dancing in my mouth!! If only every restaurant can have a beautiful/healthy/organic/fresh farm where they can get their ingredients from in the backyard.

5,Lebanon Express,"After trying some not so good mediterranean food, I am glad I stopped by this place (located close to Yonge and College subway station). The food looks and tastes really good, very flavourful and fresh.
People working there were very friendly and nice. Helped with the menu and even gave us some samples before buying.
Falafels were made fresh right in front of me (we took extra falafels that was $1.99 for 3 falafels - very soft and good).
The salad bar was tasty too, loved the beets, tabouli salad with lentils or chickpeas. Very delicious potatoes and chicken shawarma! I was very impressed by this small place (they have few tables where to sit and eat. Or you can have a take-out.)
Have to admit that chicken shawarma was one of the best I have tasted in the last year or so. The pieces were white meat without any ugly or fat pieces as I have been served in other places. I highly recomment.
The prices are okay, as the portions are pretty big.",2014-11-07,Toronto,-79.38282779999999,43.6610335,"['Middle Eastern', 'Food', 'Restaurants']"
5,Bobby Q,"WOW, DELICIOUS!!! First I would like to compliment the host and our server Autumn, they were very polite and helpful and service was very attentive and in a timely manner. The wife and I decided to have lunch before our long drive home back to SO-CAL, she spotted the restaurant sign from the freeway and liked the clever lil Bobby Q name. So I yelped it and saw good reviews, so we gave it a try. The restaurant is not hard to find, it has nice size parking lot with lots of trees and shade. When you step out of the car you instantly get hit with the delicious smell of smoking BBQ! The building has that roadhouse feeling but a more family atmosphere,  the inside is very nice and clean, dim lit and once again very nice atmosphere.  I ordered my favorite BBQ dish, the pulled pork sandwich w/ mac n cheese as my side with a lemonade.  The wife had the beef brisket and the BBQ chicken with the pecan coleslaw and mashed potatoes as her side. While we waited for our meals they brought us some delicious corn bread that must have been freshly made, it was warm and sweet. So moist you could cut it with your fork and eat it like a pastry, leaving you wanting more after the last bite. Our food came shortly after we finished the cornbread so it had to be between 5-10mins from when we gave Autumn our orders. The smell was devine and the food presentation was very nice, not like your typical BBQ joints, it seemed a lil more fine dining, the quantities are more controlled , not just slapped on the plate in mass amounts. I first dipped into the mac n cheese and I'll tell you I could have stopped right there and not have tasted another thing and I would have left a happy customer, best mac n cheese I've ever had!!! Next I took a bite of my pulled pork sandwich and it did not disappoint. The bun it was served on was fresh and warm, the pork was succulent and smokey,  sauce was sweet and tangy which complimented the smoked pork.  The wife and i sampled eachothers food and every single bite was fresh, succulent, savory and absolutely delicious.  Hands down the best BBQ I have ever eaten!!! The only thing I can complain about is we don't have a Bobby Q's over here where I live in Diamond bar, California.
P.S. 
My wife says, she thinks there should be a Barbie Q in California, we will have to make Phoenix a regular trip until then though.",2016-09-20,Phoenix,-112.115746955,33.561084804699995,"['Caterers', 'Event Planning & Services', 'American (New)', 'Barbeque', 'Restaurants']"

Walked in on a Friday night around 7:30. We were greeted and promptly seated. We then waited and waited and waited. I'd say somewhere around 10 different staff members passed by and no one stopped. After 20 minutes a waitress finally stopped by to tell us that she was off and she would see why no one wanted to serve us. After another 10 minutes we got up and left. 
On the way out the door I stopped back at the hostess and asked why there were 10+ people working and yet no one cared about helping us. She replied ""uh, (pause) sorry. Where were you seated?""  I was seated right where you sat me!

I hate that I don't live in their delivery radius anymore, because they are the best pizza franchise I've ever been to. The pizza is tremendously good. It tastes like quality.

2,Green Tea Bistro,"Came in for the first time and ordered To-Go. Clean restaurant and Friendly Service.

Everything else was terrible.
I ordered tofu vegetable soup and chicken fried rice. 

I bring it home (after paying $15 for just soup and rice) and find no vegetables in this soup aside from a few mushrooms and a few bamboo shoots. It was watered down egg drop soup with very small, flavorless tofu pieces.

Next I opened my fried rice, which has a strange yellow color to it... not from turmeric, it was just odd to me.

I'm starving so decide to eat the food I'm disappointed in that I feel I paid way too much. I take a first bite of fried rice and get a giant piece of chicken gristle, no meat. Ugh, it got worse... no vegetables in the fried rice, just a few small pieces of green onion.

I am sad because this is the closest Asian style restaurant to my home... but I honestly will never go back.

An hour and a half passed and I called back to find out where my order was. The girl on the phone said that the delivery guys were all out and that if I didn't get anything in 10 minutes to call back. After about 20 minutes I called back now about 2 hours since I ordered and still no food. The girl on the phone transferred me to someone else to figure it out. They said they called me to say that the appetizer I ordered was out and the person that answered the phone said they didn't order anything. After trying to explain that I had never received a call we realized that because I live in an apartment the phone number with my address was someone that previously lived there. I would assume that if when they called and the person said they didn't order they would've realized this and tried to get back in contact with me. 

So I gave them my correct phone number and the employee was going to call me back about what to do. When I received a call back they were going to give me another appetizer instead.. at this point it had been over 2 hours and 3 phone calls later and they weren't even offering to comp my meal. At this point I just told them to cancel the order completely.

Two days ago, I stopped in and asked for half a pound of BBQ pork.  The man places a piece of meat onto the scale and it read: .46 lb.  Ok, so at $8.95/lb and I'm getting .46/lb, it should be $4.12.  By the time I get to the cashier, she tells me the total is $6.62.  WTF?!?!?  Did I get charged for having it sliced into smaller pieces?  So I ask the cashier, why it was so expensive because the man told me it would be $4.12.  She tells me, ""It's the tax"".  So I pay and leave because I'm so hungry.  On the drive home, I look at the receipt and notice she charged me $6.12+$0.50 tax!! The man wrote $6.12 on the container so he was obviously trying to pull a fast one on me.

We didn't have any problems with the service (as other reviewers had). The waiter was jovial and answered all of our questions. Our cups never went empty! 

I would have given Ninja City 4 stars if it hadn't been for the gyoza dumplings. These 3 dumplings were the absolute WORST dumplings I have ever had. Greasy, but not in a good way. Flavorless. Shriveled. If a genie gave me three wishes today, one of them would be to untaste those dumplings. 

The Korean rice bowl with chicken is what saved this meal from being an outright disappointment for me. All of the components - from the spicy kimchi to the sliced cucumber - were delicious.

I will go into the details later, but for the $20 tip that I left for the service, I would have rather had a sandwich at the local deli.  First, as you walk in, you are greeted by a throng of women wearing rather short skirts.  I had to ask if this was going to be a restaurant known for their women servers or their food.  I think the former.  If I wanted eye candy, I would have gone to twin peaks or the tilted kilt.  Anyway, the menu was limited and your entire party  had to share a plain paper menu.  I was surprised that they couldn't afford to make copies so that the entire party could have their own menu.  That was the first red flag.  Then, you had to share one appetizer, no matter how large your party.  So, if you ordered the deviled eggs and you had 4 in your party, everyone would have 1/2 egg for their appetizer.  BTW, their deviled eggs were very ordinary.  Red flag number 2.  Then, for your main entree, the party had to each pick different entrees and could not pick the same one.  If this was truely a training exercise,  why would it matter.  I ordered the green chili burger that had no green chili on it and tasted like a fancy Big Mac, the fries were cold.  My companion had the salmon which looked and tasted great.  The entire lunch, including two drinks would have cost $80.00.  I had other workmates that also had similar experiences.  A table of 4 had a bill over $140.00.  If this is supposed to be a truely casual lunch spot, hence the ""grill"" name, then it is way over priced.",2012-06-05,Phoenix,-112.02400360200001,33.5092305009,"['Steakhouses', 'Bars', 'Breakfast & Brunch', 'Restaurants', 'Nightlife']"
3,The Coffee Pot,"The waiters and waitresses were seriously incredible and so attentive.  Five stars to the staff.  But the food just wasn't that great.  The pancakes were unimpressive.  The eggs lacked something.... weird.  I loved the small, cozy diner feel though;  I just wish the food was better.",2016-04-03,Lakewood,-81.77581409999999,41.4768582,"['Diners', 'Restaurants', 'Breakfast & Brunch']"
4,Elliot's Barbeque,I think I've officially had my first taste of real southern BBQ.  This stuff was slow cooked and flavored just right.  I really liked how the brisket was nice and tender.  And the sauce a very nice addition to the flavors of the meat.  The people were fast and friendly and it was a really fun time.,2008-09-06,Matthews,-80.7126574,35.133888,"['Barbeque', 'Restaurants']"
